    "As we have seen, pairs provide a primitive “glue” that we can use to construct compound data objects. [Figure 2.2](#Figure-2_002e2) shows a standard way to visualize a pair—in this case, the pair formed by `(cons 1 2)`. In this representation, which is called *box-and-pointer notation*, each object is shown as a *pointer* to a box. The box for a primitive object contains a representation of the object. For example, the box for a number contains a numeral. The box for a pair is actually a double box, the left part containing (a pointer to) the `car` of the pair and the right part containing the `cdr`.\n",

    "We have already seen that `cons` can be used to combine not only numbers but pairs as well. (You made use of this fact, or should have, in doing [Exercise 2.2](2_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-2_002e2) and [Exercise 2.3](2_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-2_002e3).) As a consequence, pairs provide a universal building block from which we can construct all sorts of data structures. [Figure 2.3](#Figure-2_002e3) shows two ways to use pairs to combine the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence of list structure’s importance as a representational tool. We refer to this ability as the *closure property* of `cons`. In general, an operation for combining data objects satisfies the closure property if the results of combining things with that operation can themselves be combined using the same operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The use of the word “closure” here comes from abstract algebra, where a set of elements is said to be closed under an operation if applying the operation to elements in the set produces an element that is again an element of the set. The Lisp community also (unfortunately) uses the word “closure” to describe a totally unrelated concept: A closure is an implementation technique for representing procedures with free variables. We do not use the word “closure” in this second sense in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closure is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create *hierarchical* structures—structures made up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the outset of [Chapter 1](Chapter-1.xhtml#Chapter-1), we’ve made essential use of closure in dealing with procedures, because all but the very simplest programs rely on the fact that the elements of a combination can themselves be combinations. In this section, we take up the consequences of closure for compound data. We describe some conventional techniques for using pairs to represent sequences and trees, and we exhibit a graphics language that illustrates closure in a vivid way.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The notion that a means of combination should satisfy closure is a straightforward idea. Unfortunately, the data combiners provided in many popular programming languages do not satisfy closure, or make closure cumbersome to exploit. In Fortran or Basic, one typically combines data elements by assembling them into arrays—but one cannot form arrays whose elements are themselves arrays. Pascal and C admit structures whose elements are structures. However, this requires that the programmer manipulate pointers explicitly, and adhere to the restriction that each field of a structure can contain only elements of a prespecified form. Unlike Lisp with its pairs, these languages have no built-in general-purpose glue that makes it easy to manipulate compound data in a uniform way. This limitation lies behind Alan Perlis’s comment in his foreword to this book: “In Pascal the plethora of declarable data structures induces a specialization within functions that inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation. It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.”]\n",

    "## 2.2.1 Representing Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the useful structures we can build with pairs is a *sequence*—an ordered collection of data objects. There are, of course, many ways to represent sequences in terms of pairs. One particularly straightforward representation is illustrated in [Figure 2.4](#Figure-2_002e4), where the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 is represented as a chain of pairs. The `car` of each pair is the corresponding item in the chain, and the `cdr` of the pair is the next pair in the chain. The `cdr` of the final pair signals the end of the sequence by pointing to a distinguished value that is not a pair, represented in box-and-pointer diagrams as a diagonal line and in programs as the value of the variable `nil`. The entire sequence is constructed by nested `cons` operations:"

In Scheme, `nil` is an ordinary name, which we use in this section as a variable whose value is the end-of-list marker (just as `true` is an ordinary variable that has a true value). Other dialects of Lisp, including Common Lisp, treat `nil` as a special symbol. The authors of this book, who have endured too many language standardization brawls, would like to avoid the entire issue.

    "`Map` is an important construct, not only because it captures a common pattern, but because it establishes a higher level of abstraction in dealing with lists. In the original definition of `scale-list`, the recursive structure of the program draws attention to the element-by-element processing of the list. Defining `scale-list` in terms of `map` suppresses that level of detail and emphasizes that scaling transforms a list of elements to a list of results. The difference between the two definitions is not that the computer is performing a different process (it isn’t) but that we think about the process differently. In effect, `map` helps establish an abstraction barrier that isolates the implementation of procedures that transform lists from the details of how the elements of the list are extracted and combined. Like the barriers shown in [Figure 2.1](2_002e1.xhtml#Figure-2_002e1), this abstraction gives us the flexibility to change the low-level details of how sequences are implemented, while preserving the conceptual framework of operations that transform sequences to sequences. Section [2.2.3](#g_t2_002e2_002e3) expands on this use of sequences as a framework for organizing programs.\n",

    "__What's wrong with `cons`__\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scheme, `cons` is a primitive procedure that creates a new pair from two values. The first value becomes the first element of the pair, and the second value becomes the second element of the pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `cons` with two arguments, it creates a new pair whose first element is the first argument and whose second element is the second argument. For example, `(cons 1 2)` creates a new pair whose first element is `1` and whose second element is `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `cons` with a single argument, it creates a new pair whose first element is the single argument and whose second element is `null`. For example, `(cons 1)` creates a new pair whose first element is `1` and whose second element is `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call `cons` with two lists as arguments, the result is a new list that consists of the first list followed by the second list. For example, `(cons '(1 2) '(3 4))` creates a new list `(1 2 3 4)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you call `cons` with a single list as the first argument and a non-list value as the second argument, the result is a pair whose first element is the list and whose second element is the non-list value. For example, `(cons '(1 2) 3)` creates a new pair whose first element is `(1 2)` and whose second element is `3`. This is not a list because the second element is not a list."

In `sum-odd-squares`, we begin with an *enumerator*, which generates a “signal” consisting of the leaves of a given tree. This signal is passed through a *filter*, which eliminates all but the odd elements. The resulting signal is in turn passed through a *map*, which is a “transducer” that applies the `square` procedure to each element. The output of the map is then fed to an *accumulator*, which combines the elements using `+`, starting from an initial 0. The plan for `even-fibs` is analogous.\n",

For instance, if we examine the `sum-odd-squares` procedure, we find that the enumeration is implemented partly by the `null?` and `pair?` tests and partly by the tree-recursive structure of the procedure. Similarly, the accumulation is found partly in the tests and partly in the addition used in the recursion. In general, there are no distinct parts of either procedure that correspond to the elements in the signal-flow description. Our two procedures decompose the computations in a different way, spreading the enumeration over the program and mingling it with the map, the filter, and the accumulation. If we could organize our programs to make the signal-flow structure manifest in the procedures we write, this would increase the conceptual clarity of the resulting code.\n",

    "These examples give just a hint of the vast range of operations that can be expressed as sequence operations.^[Richard [Waters (1979)](References.xhtml#Waters-_00281979_0029) developed a program that automatically analyzes traditional Fortran programs, viewing them in terms of maps, filters, and accumulations. He found that fully 90 percent of the code in the Fortran Scientific Subroutine Package fits neatly into this paradigm. One of the reasons for the success of Lisp as a programming language is that lists provide a standard medium for expressing ordered collections so that they can be manipulated using higher-order operations. The programming language APL owes much of its power and appeal to a similar choice. In APL all data are represented as arrays, and there is a universal and convenient set of generic operators for all sorts of array operations.]\n",

G. Horner early in the nineteenth century, but the method was actually used by Newton over a hundred years earlier. Horner’s rule evaluates the polynomial using fewer additions and multiplications than does the straightforward method of first computing $a_{n}x^{n}$, then adding $a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1}$, and so on. In fact, it is possible to prove that any algorithm for evaluating arbitrary polynomials must use at least as many additions and multiplications as does Horner’s rule, and thus Horner’s rule is an optimal algorithm for polynomial evaluation. This was proved (for the number of additions) by A. M. Ostrowski in a 1954 paper that essentially founded the modern study of optimal algorithms. The analogous statement for multiplications was proved by V. Y. Pan in 1966. The book by [Borodin and Munro (1975)](References.xhtml#Borodin-and-Munro-_00281975_0029) provides an overview of these and other results about optimal algorithms.]\n",

    "### Nested Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend the sequence paradigm to include many computations that are commonly expressed using nested loops.^[This approach to nested mappings was shown to us by David Turner, whose languages KRC and Miranda provide elegant formalisms for dealing with these constructs. The examples in this section (see also [Exercise 2.42](#Exercise-2_002e42)) are adapted from [Turner 1981](References.xhtml#Turner-1981). In [3.5.3](3_002e5.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e3), we’ll see how this approach generalizes to infinite sequences.] Consider this problem: Given a positive integer $n$, find all ordered pairs of distinct positive integers $i$ and $j$, where ${1 \\leq j} < {i \\leq n}$, such that $i + j$ is prime. For example, if $n$ is 6, then the pairs are the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{llllllll}\n",
    "i & 2 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n",
    "j & 1 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n",
    "{i + j} & 3 & 5 & 5 & 7 & 7 & 7 & 11 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " A natural way to organize this computation is to generate the sequence of all ordered pairs of positive integers less than or equal to $n$, filter to select those pairs whose sum is prime, and then, for each pair $(i,j)$ that passes through the filter, produce the triple $(i,j,i + j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a way to generate the sequence of pairs: For each integer $i \\leq n$, enumerate the integers $j < i$, and for each such $i$ and $j$ generate the pair $(i,j)$. In terms of sequence operations, we map along the sequence `(enumerate-interval 1 n)`. For each $i$ in this sequence, we map along the sequence `(enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))`. For each $j$ in this latter sequence, we generate the pair `(list i j)`. This gives us a sequence of pairs for each $i$. Combining all the sequences for all the $i$ (by accumulating with `append`) produces the required sequence of pairs:^[We’re representing a pair here as a list of two elements rather than as a Lisp pair. Thus, the “pair” $(i,j)$ is represented as `(list i j)`, not `(cons i j)`.]"

One possible solution is shown in [Figure 2.8](#Figure-2_002e8). One way to solve the puzzle is to work across the board, placing a queen in each column. Once we have placed $k - 1$ queens, we must place the $k^{\\text{th}}$ queen in a position where it does not check any of the queens already on the board. We can formulate this approach recursively: Assume that we have already generated the sequence of all possible ways to place $k - 1$ queens in the first $k - 1$ columns of the board. For each of these ways, generate an extended set of positions by placing a queen in each row of the $k^{\\text{th}}$ column. Now filter these, keeping only the positions for which the queen in the $k^{\\text{th}}$ column is safe with respect to the other queens. This produces the sequence of all ways to place $k$ queens in the first $k$ columns. By continuing this process, we will produce not only one solution, but all solutions to the puzzle.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section presents a simple language for drawing pictures that illustrates the power of data abstraction and closure, and also exploits higher-order procedures in an essential way. The language is designed to make it easy to experiment with patterns such as the ones in [Figure 2.9](#Figure-2_002e9), which are composed of repeated elements that are shifted and scaled.^[The picture language is based on the language Peter Henderson created to construct images like M.C. Escher’s “Square Limit” woodcut (see [Henderson 1982](References.xhtml#Henderson-1982)). The woodcut incorporates a repeated scaled pattern, similar to the arrangements drawn using the `square-limit` procedure in this section.] In this language, the data objects being combined are represented as procedures rather than as list structure. Just as `cons`, which satisfies the closure property, allowed us to easily build arbitrarily complicated list structure, the operations in this language, which also satisfy the closure property, allow us to easily build arbitrarily complicated patterns.\n",

    "When we began our study of programming in [1.1](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1), we emphasized the importance of describing a language by focusing on the language’s primitives, its means of combination, and its means of abstraction. We’ll follow that framework here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the elegance of this picture language is that there is only one kind of element, called a *painter*. A painter draws an image that is shifted and scaled to fit within a designated parallelogram-shaped frame. For example, there’s a primitive painter we’ll call `wave` that makes a crude line drawing, as shown in [Figure 2.10](#Figure-2_002e10). The actual shape of the drawing depends on the frame—all four images in figure 2.10 are produced by the same `wave` painter, but with respect to four different frames. Painters can be more elaborate than this: The primitive painter called `rogers` paints a picture of MIT’s founder, William Barton Rogers, as shown in [Figure 2.11](#Figure-2_002e11).^[William Barton Rogers (1804-1882) was the founder and first president of MIT. A geologist and talented teacher, he taught at William and Mary College and at the University of Virginia. In 1859 he moved to Boston, where he had more time for research, worked on a plan for establishing a “polytechnic institute,” and served as Massachusetts’s first State Inspector of Gas Meters.] The four images in figure 2.11 are drawn with respect to the same four frames as the `wave` images in figure 2.10.\n",

    "\n",
    "To combine images, we use various operations that construct new painters from given painters. For example, the `beside` operation takes two painters and produces a new, compound painter that draws the first painter’s image in the left half of the frame and the second painter’s image in the right half of the frame. Similarly, `below` takes two painters and produces a compound painter that draws the first painter’s image below the second painter’s image. Some operations transform a single painter to produce a new painter. For example, `flip-vert` takes a painter and produces a painter that draws its image upside-down, and `flip-horiz` produces a painter that draws the original painter’s image left-to-right reversed.\n",

We can create and intermix all sorts of primitive painters, based on a variety of graphics capabilities. The details of their implementation do not matter.

For each point in a given frame, the `rogers` painter determines the point in the image that is mapped to it under the frame coordinate map, and shades it accordingly. By allowing different types of painters, we are capitalizing on the abstract data idea discussed in [2.1.3](2_002e1.xhtml#g_t2_002e1_002e3), where we argued that a rational-number representation could be anything at all that satisfies an appropriate condition. Here we’re using the fact that a painter can be implemented in any way at all, so long as it draws something in the designated frame.

    "**Exercise 2.51:** Define the `below` operation for painters. `Below` takes two painters as arguments. The resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first painter in the bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the top. Define `below` in two different ways—first by writing a procedure that is analogous to the `beside` procedure given above, and again in terms of `beside` and suitable rotation operations (from [Exercise 2.50](#Exercise-2_002e50)).\n",

    "### Levels of language for robust design\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture language exercises some of the critical ideas we’ve introduced about abstraction with procedures and data. The fundamental data abstractions, painters, are implemented using procedural representations, which enables the language to handle different basic drawing capabilities in a uniform way. The means of combination satisfy the closure property, which permits us to easily build up complex designs. Finally, all the tools for abstracting procedures are available to us for abstracting means of combination for painters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about languages and program design. This is the approach of *stratified design*, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified design pervades the engineering of complex systems. For example, in computer engineering, resistors and transistors are combined (and described using a language of analog circuits) to produce parts such as and-gates and or-gates, which form the primitives of a language for digital-circuit design.^[Section [3.3.4](3_002e3.xhtml#g_t3_002e3_002e4) describes one such language.] These parts are combined to build processors, bus structures, and memory systems, which are in turn combined to form computers, using languages appropriate to computer architecture. Computers are combined to form distributed systems, using languages appropriate for describing network interconnections, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a tiny example of stratification, our picture language uses primitive elements (primitive painters) that are created using a language that specifies points and lines to provide the lists of line segments for `segments->painter`, or the shading details for a painter like `rogers`. The bulk of our description of the picture language focused on combining these primitives, using geometric combiners such as `beside` and `below`. We also worked at a higher level, regarding `beside` and `below` as primitives to be manipulated in a language whose operations, such as `square-of-four`, capture common patterns of combining geometric combiners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified design helps make programs *robust*, that is, it makes it likely that small changes in a specification will require correspondingly small changes in the program. For instance, suppose we wanted to change the image based on `wave` shown in [Figure 2.9](#Figure-2_002e9). We could work at the lowest level to change the detailed appearance of the `wave` element; we could work at the middle level to change the way `corner-split` replicates the `wave`; we could work at the highest level to change how `square-limit` arranges the four copies of the corner. In general, each level of a stratified design provides a different vocabulary for expressing the characteristics of the system, and a different kind of ability to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2.52:** Make changes to the square limit of `wave` shown in [Figure 2.9](#Figure-2_002e9) by working at each of the levels described above. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Add some segments to the primitive `wave` painter of [Exercise 2.49](#Exercise-2_002e49) (to add a smile, for example).\n",
    "2.  Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split` (for example, by using only one copy of the `up-split` and `right-split` images instead of two).\n",
    "3.  Modify the version of `square-limit` that uses `square-of-four` so as to assemble the corners in a different pattern. (For example, you might make the big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of the square.)"
