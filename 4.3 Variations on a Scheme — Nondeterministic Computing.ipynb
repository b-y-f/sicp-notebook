    "# 4.3 Variations on a Scheme — Nondeterministic Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we extend the Scheme evaluator to support a programming paradigm called *nondeterministic computing* by building into the evaluator a facility to support automatic search. This is a much more profound change to the language than the introduction of lazy evaluation in [4.2](4_002e2.xhtml#g_t4_002e2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nondeterministic computing, like stream processing, is useful for “generate and test” applications. Consider the task of starting with two lists of positive integers and finding a pair of integers—one from the first list and one from the second list—whose sum is prime. We saw how to handle this with finite sequence operations in [2.2.3](2_002e2.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e3) and with infinite streams in [3.5.3](3_002e5.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e3). Our approach was to generate the sequence of all possible pairs and filter these to select the pairs whose sum is prime. Whether we actually generate the entire sequence of pairs first as in [Chapter 2](Chapter-2.xhtml#Chapter-2), or interleave the generating and filtering as in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3), is immaterial to the essential image of how the computation is organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nondeterministic approach evokes a different image. Imagine simply that we choose (in some way) a number from the first list and a number from the second list and require (using some mechanism) that their sum be prime. This is expressed by following procedure:"

    "It might seem as if this procedure merely restates the problem, rather than specifying a way to solve it. Nevertheless, this is a legitimate nondeterministic program.^[We assume that we have previously defined a procedure `prime?` that tests whether numbers are prime. Even with `prime?` defined, the `prime-sum-pair` procedure may look suspiciously like the unhelpful “pseudo-Lisp” attempt to define the square-root function, which we described at the beginning of [1.1.7](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7). In fact, a square-root procedure along those lines can actually be formulated as a nondeterministic program. By incorporating a search mechanism into the evaluator, we are eroding the distinction between purely declarative descriptions and imperative specifications of how to compute answers. We’ll go even farther in this direction in [4.4](4_002e4.xhtml#g_t4_002e4).]\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is that expressions in a nondeterministic language can have more than one possible value. For instance, `an-element-of` might return any element of the given list. Our nondeterministic program evaluator will work by automatically choosing a possible value and keeping track of the choice. If a subsequent requirement is not met, the evaluator will try a different choice, and it will keep trying new choices until the evaluation succeeds, or until we run out of choices. Just as the lazy evaluator freed the programmer from the details of how values are delayed and forced, the nondeterministic program evaluator will free the programmer from the details of how choices are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is instructive to contrast the different images of time evoked by nondeterministic evaluation and stream processing. Stream processing uses lazy evaluation to decouple the time when the stream of possible answers is assembled from the time when the actual stream elements are produced. The evaluator supports the illusion that all the possible answers are laid out before us in a timeless sequence. With nondeterministic evaluation, an expression represents the exploration of a set of possible worlds, each determined by a set of choices. Some of the possible worlds lead to dead ends, while others have useful values. The nondeterministic program evaluator supports the illusion that time branches, and that our programs have different possible execution histories. When we reach a dead end, we can revisit a previous choice point and proceed along a different branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nondeterministic program evaluator implemented below is called the `amb` evaluator because it is based on a new special form called `amb`. We can type the above definition of `prime-sum-pair` at the `amb` evaluator driver loop (along with definitions of `prime?`, `an-element-of`, and `require`) and run the procedure as follows:"

    "This is like the stream procedure `integers-starting-from` described in [3.5.2](3_002e5.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e2), but with an important difference: The stream procedure returns an object that represents the sequence of all integers beginning with $n$, whereas the `amb` procedure returns a single integer.^[In actuality, the distinction between nondeterministically returning a single choice and returning all choices depends somewhat on our point of view. From the perspective of the code that uses the value, the nondeterministic choice returns a single value. From the perspective of the programmer designing the code, the nondeterministic choice potentially returns all possible values, and the computation branches so that each value is investigated separately.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractly, we can imagine that evaluating an `amb` expression causes time to split into branches, where the computation continues on each branch with one of the possible values of the expression. We say that `amb` represents a *nondeterministic choice point*. If we had a machine with a sufficient number of processors that could be dynamically allocated, we could implement the search in a straightforward way. Execution would proceed as in a sequential machine, until an `amb` expression is encountered. At this point, more processors would be allocated and initialized to continue all of the parallel executions implied by the choice. Each processor would proceed sequentially as if it were the only choice, until it either terminates by encountering a failure, or it further subdivides, or it finishes.^[One might object that this is a hopelessly inefficient mechanism. It might require millions of processors to solve some easily stated problem this way, and most of the time most of those processors would be idle. This objection should be taken in the context of history. Memory used to be considered just such an expensive commodity. In 1964 a megabyte of RAM cost about \\$400,000. Now every personal computer has many megabytes of RAM, and most of the time most of that RAM is unused. It is hard to underestimate the cost of mass-produced electronics.]\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we have a machine that can execute only one process (or a few concurrent processes), we must consider the alternatives sequentially. One could imagine modifying an evaluator to pick at random a branch to follow whenever it encounters a choice point. Random choice, however, can easily lead to failing values. We might try running the evaluator over and over, making random choices and hoping to find a non-failing value, but it is better to *systematically search* all possible execution paths. The `amb` evaluator that we will develop and work with in this section implements a systematic search as follows: When the evaluator encounters an application of `amb`, it initially selects the first alternative. This selection may itself lead to a further choice. The evaluator will always initially choose the first alternative at each choice point. If a choice results in a failure, then the evaluator automagically^[utomagically: “Automatically, but in a way which, for some reason (typically because it is too complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker doesn’t feel like explaining.” ([Steele et al. 1983](References.xhtml#Steele-et-al_002e-1983), [Raymond 1993](References.xhtml#Raymond-1993))] *backtracks* to the most recent choice point and tries the next alternative. If it runs out of alternatives at any choice point, the evaluator will back up to the previous choice point and resume from there. This process leads to a search strategy known as *depth-first search* or *chronological backtracking*.^[The integration of automatic search strategies into programming languages has had a long and checkered history. The first suggestions that nondeterministic algorithms might be elegantly encoded in a programming language with search and automatic backtracking came from Robert [Floyd (1967)](References.xhtml#Floyd-_00281967_0029). Carl [Hewitt (1969)](References.xhtml#Hewitt-_00281969_0029) invented a programming language called Planner that explicitly supported automatic chronological backtracking, providing for a built-in depth-first search strategy. [Sussman et al. (1971)](References.xhtml#Sussman-et-al_002e-_00281971_0029) implemented a subset of this language, called MicroPlanner, which was used to support work in problem solving and robot planning. Similar ideas, arising from logic and theorem proving, led to the genesis in Edinburgh and Marseille of the elegant language Prolog (which we will discuss in [4.4](4_002e4.xhtml#g_t4_002e4)). After sufficient frustration with automatic search, [McDermott and Sussman (1972)](References.xhtml#McDermott-and-Sussman-_00281972_0029) developed a language called Conniver, which included mechanisms for placing the search strategy under programmer control. This proved unwieldy, however, and [Sussman and Stallman 1975](References.xhtml#Sussman-and-Stallman-1975) found a more tractable approach while investigating methods of symbolic analysis for electrical circuits. They developed a non-chronological backtracking scheme that was based on tracing out the logical dependencies connecting facts, a technique that has come to be known as *dependency-directed backtracking*. Although their method was complex, it produced reasonably efficient programs because it did little redundant search. [Doyle (1979)](References.xhtml#Doyle-_00281979_0029) and [McAllester (1978; 1980)](References.xhtml#McAllester-_00281978_003b-1980_0029) generalized and clarified the methods of Stallman and Sussman, developing a new paradigm for formulating search that is now called *truth maintenance*. Modern problem-solving systems all use some form of truth-maintenance system as a substrate. See [Forbus and deKleer 1993](References.xhtml#Forbus-and-deKleer-1993) for a discussion of elegant ways to build truth-maintenance systems and applications using truth maintenance. [Zabih et al. 1987](References.xhtml#Zabih-et-al_002e-1987) describes a nondeterministic extension to Scheme that is based on `amb`; it is similar to the interpreter described in this section, but more sophisticated, because it uses dependency-directed backtracking rather than chronological backtracking. [Winston 1992](References.xhtml#Winston-1992) gives an introduction to both kinds of backtracking.]\n",

    "### Driver loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The driver loop for the `amb` evaluator has some unusual properties. It reads an expression and prints the value of the first non-failing execution, as in the `prime-sum-pair` example shown above. If we want to see the value of the next successful execution, we can ask the interpreter to backtrack and attempt to generate a second non-failing execution. This is signaled by typing the symbol `try-again`. If any expression except `try-again` is given, the interpreter will start a new problem, discarding the unexplored alternatives in the previous problem. Here is a sample interaction:"

In contrast, we will base the `amb` evaluator on the analyzing evaluator of [4.1.7](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e7), because the execution procedures in that evaluator provide a convenient framework for implementing backtracking.] As in the analyzing evaluator, evaluation of an expression is accomplished by calling an execution procedure produced by analysis of that expression. The difference between the interpretation of ordinary Scheme and the interpretation of nondeterministic Scheme will be entirely in the execution procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution procedures and continuations\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the execution procedures for the ordinary evaluator take one argument: the environment of execution. In contrast, the execution procedures in the `amb` evaluator take three arguments: the environment, and two procedures called *continuation procedures*. The evaluation of an expression will finish by calling one of these two continuations: If the evaluation results in a value, the *success continuation* is called with that value; if the evaluation results in the discovery of a dead end, the *failure continuation* is called. Constructing and calling appropriate continuations is the mechanism by which the nondeterministic evaluator implements backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the job of the success continuation to receive a value and proceed with the computation. Along with that value, the success continuation is passed another failure continuation, which is to be called subsequently if the use of that value leads to a dead end.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the job of the failure continuation to try another branch of the nondeterministic process. The essence of the nondeterministic language is in the fact that expressions may represent choices among alternatives. The evaluation of such an expression must proceed with one of the indicated alternative choices, even though it is not known in advance which choices will lead to acceptable results. To deal with this, the evaluator picks one of the alternatives and passes this value to the success continuation. Together with this value, the evaluator constructs and passes along a failure continuation that can be called later to choose a different alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "A failure is triggered during evaluation (that is, a failure continuation is called) when a user program explicitly rejects the current line of attack (for example, a call to `require` may result in execution of `(amb)`, an expression that always fails—see [4.3.1](#g_t4_002e3_002e1)). The failure continuation in hand at that point will cause the most recent choice point to choose another alternative. If there are no more alternatives to be considered at that choice point, a failure at an earlier choice point is triggered, and so on. Failure continuations are also invoked by the driver loop in response to a `try-again` request, to find another value of the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if a side-effect operation (such as assignment to a variable) occurs on a branch of the process resulting from a choice, it may be necessary, when the process finds a dead end, to undo the side effect before making a new choice. This is accomplished by having the side-effect operation produce a failure continuation that undoes the side effect and propagates the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, failure continuations are constructed by\n",
    "\n",
    "- `amb` expressions—to provide a mechanism to make alternative choices if the current choice made by the `amb` expression leads to a dead end;\n",
    "- the top-level driver—to provide a mechanism to report failure when the choices are exhausted;\n",
    "- assignments—to intercept failures and undo assignments during backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failures are initiated only when a dead end is encountered. This occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the user program executes `(amb)`;\n",
    "- if the user types `try-again` at the top-level driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure continuations are also called during processing of a failure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the failure continuation created by an assignment finishes undoing a side effect, it calls the failure continuation it intercepted, in order to propagate the failure back to the choice point that led to this assignment or to the top level.\n",
    "- When the failure continuation for an `amb` runs out of choices, it calls the failure continuation that was originally given to the `amb`, in order to propagate the failure back to the previous choice point or to the top level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax- and data-representation procedures for the `amb` evaluator, and also the basic `analyze` procedure, are identical to those in the evaluator of [4.1.7](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e7), except for the fact that we need additional syntax procedures to recognize the `amb` special form:^[We assume that the evaluator supports `let` (see [Exercise 4.22](4_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-4_002e22)), which we have used in our nondeterministic programs.]"

    "\n",
    "The driver loop for the `amb` evaluator is complex, due to the mechanism that permits the user to try again in evaluating an expression. The driver uses a procedure called `internal-loop`, which takes as argument a procedure `try-again`. The intent is that calling `try-again` should go on to the next untried alternative in the nondeterministic evaluation. `Internal-loop` either calls `try-again` in response to the user typing `try-again` at the driver loop, or else starts a new evaluation by calling `ambeval`.\n",

    "The success continuation for the call to `ambeval` is more subtle. We print the obtained value and then invoke the internal loop again with a `try-again` procedure that will be able to try the next alternative. This `next-alternative` procedure is the second argument that was passed to the success continuation. Ordinarily, we think of this second argument as a failure continuation to be used if the current evaluation branch later fails. In this case, however, we have completed a successful evaluation, so we can invoke the “failure” alternative branch in order to search for additional successful evaluations."
