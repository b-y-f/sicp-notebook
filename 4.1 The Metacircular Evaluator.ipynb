    "# 4.1 The Metacircular Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluator for Lisp will be implemented as a Lisp program. It may seem circular to think about evaluating Lisp programs using an evaluator that is itself implemented in Lisp. However, evaluation is a process, so it is appropriate to describe the evaluation process using Lisp, which, after all, is our tool for describing processes.^[Even so, there will remain important aspects of the evaluation process that are not elucidated by our evaluator. The most important of these are the detailed mechanisms by which procedures call other procedures and return values to their callers. We will address these issues in [Chapter 5](Chapter-5.xhtml#Chapter-5), where we take a closer look at the evaluation process by implementing the evaluator as a simple register machine.] An evaluator that is written in the same language that it evaluates is said to be *metacircular*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metacircular evaluator is essentially a Scheme formulation of the environment model of evaluation described in [3.2](3_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e2). Recall that the model has two basic parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  To evaluate a combination (a compound expression other than a special form), evaluate the subexpressions and then apply the value of the operator subexpression to the values of the operand subexpressions.\n",
    "2.  To apply a compound procedure to a set of arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure in a new environment. To construct this environment, extend the environment part of the procedure object by a frame in which the formal parameters of the procedure are bound to the arguments to which the procedure is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two rules describe the essence of the evaluation process, a basic cycle in which expressions to be evaluated in environments are reduced to procedures to be applied to arguments, which in turn are reduced to new expressions to be evaluated in new environments, and so on, until we get down to symbols, whose values are looked up in the environment, and to primitive procedures, which are applied directly (see [Figure 4.1](#Figure-4_002e1)).^[If we grant ourselves the ability to apply primitives, then what remains for us to implement in the evaluator? The job of the evaluator is not to specify the primitives of the language, but rather to provide the connective tissue—the means of combination and the means of abstraction—that binds a collection of primitives to form a language. Specifically:] This evaluation cycle will be embodied by the interplay between the two critical procedures in the evaluator, `eval` and `apply`, which are described in [4.1.1](#g_t4_002e1_002e1) (see [Figure 4.1](#Figure-4_002e1)).\n",

    "**Figure 4.1:** The `eval`-`apply` cycle exposes the essence of a computer language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the evaluator will depend upon procedures that define the *syntax* of the expressions to be evaluated. We will use data abstraction to make the evaluator independent of the representation of the language. For example, rather than committing to a choice that an assignment is to be represented by a list beginning with the symbol `set!` we use an abstract predicate `assignment?` to test for an assignment, and we use abstract selectors `assignment-variable` and `assignment-value` to access the parts of an assignment. Implementation of expressions will be described in detail in [4.1.2](#g_t4_002e1_002e2). There are also operations, described in [4.1.3](#g_t4_002e1_002e3), that specify the representation of procedures and environments. For example, `make-procedure` constructs compound procedures, `lookup-variable-value` accesses the values of variables, and `apply-primitive-procedure` applies a primitive procedure to a given list of arguments.\n",

    "\n",
    "`Eval` takes as arguments an expression and an environment. It classifies the expression and directs its evaluation. `Eval` is structured as a case analysis of the syntactic type of the expression to be evaluated. In order to keep the procedure general, we express the determination of the type of an expression abstractly, making no commitment to any particular representation for the various types of expressions. Each type of expression has a predicate that tests for it and an abstract means for selecting its parts. This *abstract syntax* makes it easy to see how we can change the syntax of the language by using the same evaluator, but with a different collection of syntax procedures.\n",

    "- An assignment to (or a definition of) a variable must recursively call `eval` to compute the new value to be associated with the variable. The environment must be modified to change (or create) the binding of the variable.\n",
    "- An `if` expression requires special processing of its parts, so as to evaluate the consequent if the predicate is true, and otherwise to evaluate the alternative.\n",
    "- A `lambda` expression must be transformed into an applicable procedure by packaging together the parameters and body specified by the `lambda` expression with the environment of the evaluation.\n",
    "- A `begin` expression requires evaluating its sequence of expressions in the order in which they appear.\n",

    "The method described here is only one of many plausible ways to represent environments. Since we used data abstraction to isolate the rest of the evaluator from the detailed choice of representation, we could change the environment representation if we wanted to. (See [Exercise 4.11](#Exercise-4_002e11).) In a production-quality Lisp system, the speed of the evaluator’s environment operations—especially that of variable lookup—has a major impact on the performance of the system. The representation described here, although conceptually simple, is not efficient and would not ordinarily be used in a production system.^[The drawback of this representation (as well as the variant in [Exercise 4.11](#Exercise-4_002e11)) is that the evaluator may have to search through many frames in order to find the binding for a given variable. (Such an approach is referred to as *deep binding*.) One way to avoid this inefficiency is to make use of a strategy called *lexical addressing*, which will be discussed in [5.5.6](5_002e5.xhtml#g_t5_002e5_002e6).]\n",

    "From this perspective, our evaluator is seen to be a *universal machine*. It mimics other machines when these are described as Lisp programs.^[The fact that the machines are described in Lisp is inessential. If we give our evaluator a Lisp program that behaves as an evaluator for some other language, say C, the Lisp evaluator will emulate the C evaluator, which in turn can emulate any machine described as a C program. Similarly, writing a Lisp evaluator in C produces a C program that can execute any Lisp program. The deep idea here is that any evaluator can emulate any other. Thus, the notion of “what can in principle be computed” (ignoring practicalities of time and memory required) is independent of the language or the computer, and instead reflects an underlying notion of *computability*. This was first demonstrated in a clear way by Alan M. Turing (1912-1954), whose 1936 paper laid the foundations for theoretical computer science. In the paper, Turing presented a simple computational model—now known as a *Turing machine*—and argued that any “effective process” can be formulated as a program for such a machine. (This argument is known as the *Church-Turing thesis*.) Turing then implemented a universal machine, i.e., a Turing machine that behaves as an evaluator for Turing-machine programs. He used this framework to demonstrate that there are well-posed problems that cannot be computed by Turing machines (see [Exercise 4.15](#Exercise-4_002e15)), and so by implication cannot be formulated as “effective processes.” Turing went on to make fundamental contributions to practical computer science as well. For example, he invented the idea of structuring programs using general-purpose subroutines. See [Hodges 1983](References.xhtml#Hodges-1983) for a biography of Turing.] This is striking. Try to imagine an analogous evaluator for electrical circuits. This would be a circuit that takes as input a signal encoding the plans for some other circuit, such as a filter. Given this input, the circuit evaluator would then behave like a filter with the same description. Such a universal electrical circuit is almost unimaginably complex. It is remarkable that the program evaluator is a rather simple program.^[Some people find it counterintuitive that an evaluator, which is implemented by a relatively simple procedure, can emulate programs that are more complex than the evaluator itself. The existence of a universal evaluator machine is a deep and wonderful property of computation. *Recursion theory*, a branch of mathematical logic, is concerned with logical limits of computation. Douglas Hofstadter’s beautiful book Gödel, Escher, Bach explores some of these ideas ([Hofstadter 1979](References.xhtml#Hofstadter-1979)).]\n",
    "\n",
    "Another striking aspect of the evaluator is that it acts as a bridge between the data objects that are manipulated by our programming language and the programming language itself. Imagine that the evaluator program (implemented in Lisp) is running, and that a user is typing expressions to the evaluator and observing the results. From the perspective of the user, an input expression such as `(* x x)` is an expression in the programming language, which the evaluator should execute. From the perspective of the evaluator, however, the expression is simply a list (in this case, a list of three symbols: `*`, `x`, and `x`) that is to be manipulated according to a well-defined set of rules.\n",

    "That the user’s programs are the evaluator’s data need not be a source of confusion. In fact, it is sometimes convenient to ignore this distinction, and to give the user the ability to explicitly evaluate a data object as a Lisp expression, by making `eval` available for use in programs. Many Lisp dialects provide a primitive `eval` procedure that takes as arguments an expression and an environment and evaluates the expression relative to the environment.^[Warning: This `eval` primitive is not identical to the `eval` procedure we implemented in [4.1.1](#g_t4_002e1_002e1), because it uses *actual* Scheme environments rather than the sample environment structures we built in [4.1.3](#g_t4_002e1_002e3). These actual environments cannot be manipulated by the user as ordinary lists; they must be accessed via `eval` or other special operations. Similarly, the `apply` primitive we saw earlier is not identical to the metacircular `apply`, because it uses actual Scheme procedures rather than the procedure objects we constructed in [4.1.3](#g_t4_002e1_002e3) and [4.1.4](#g_t4_002e1_002e4).] Thus,"

The scope of the name `odd?` is the entire body of `f`, not just the portion of the body of `f` starting at the point where the `define` for `odd?` occurs. Indeed, when we consider that `odd?` is itself defined in terms of `even?`—so that `even?` and `odd?` are mutually recursive procedures—we see that the only satisfactory interpretation of the two `define`s is to regard them as if the names `even?` and `odd?` were being added to the environment simultaneously. More generally, in block structure, the scope of a local name is the entire procedure body in which the `define` is evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it happens, our interpreter will evaluate calls to `f` correctly, but for an “accidental” reason: Since the definitions of the internal procedures come first, no calls to these procedures will be evaluated until all of them have been defined. Hence, `odd?` will have been defined by the time `even?` is executed. In fact, our sequential evaluation mechanism will give the same result as a mechanism that directly implements simultaneous definition for any procedure in which the internal definitions come first in a body and evaluation of the value expressions for the defined variables doesn’t actually use any of the defined variables. (For an example of a procedure that doesn’t obey these restrictions, so that sequential definition isn’t equivalent to simultaneous definition, see [Exercise 4.19](#Exercise-4_002e19).)^[Wanting programs to not depend on this evaluation mechanism is the reason for the “management is not responsible” remark in [Footnote 28](1_002e1.xhtml#Footnote-28) of [Chapter 1](Chapter-1.xhtml#Chapter-1). By insisting that internal definitions come first and do not use each other while the definitions are being evaluated, the IEEE standard for Scheme leaves implementors some choice in the mechanism used to evaluate these definitions. The choice of one evaluation rule rather than another here may seem like a small issue, affecting only the interpretation of “badly formed” programs. However, we will see in [5.5.6](5_002e5.xhtml#g_t5_002e5_002e6) that moving to a model of simultaneous scoping for internal definitions avoids some nasty difficulties that would otherwise arise in implementing a compiler.]\n",

One way to do this is by a syntax transformation on `lambda` expressions. Before evaluating the body of a `lambda` expression, we “scan out” and eliminate all the internal definitions in the body. The internally defined variables will be created with a `let` and then set to their values by assignment. For example, the procedure"

Hence, in Eva’s view `a` should be 5, `b` should be 15, and the result should be 20. Which (if any) of these viewpoints do you support?

Marc [Feeley (1986)](References.xhtml#Feeley-_00281986_0029) (see also [Feeley and Lapalme 1987](References.xhtml#Feeley-and-Lapalme-1987)) independently invented this technique in his master’s thesis.] We split `eval`, which takes an expression and an environment, into two parts. The procedure `analyze` takes only the expression. It performs the syntactic analysis and returns a new procedure, the *execution procedure*, that encapsulates the work to be done in executing the analyzed expression. The execution procedure takes an environment as its argument and completes the evaluation. This saves work because `analyze` will be called only once on an expression, while the execution procedure may be called many times.\n",
