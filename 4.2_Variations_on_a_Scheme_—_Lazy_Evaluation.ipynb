    "# 4.2 Variations on a Scheme — Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an evaluator expressed as a Lisp program, we can experiment with alternative choices in language design simply by modifying the evaluator. Indeed, new languages are often invented by first writing an evaluator that embeds the new language within an existing high-level language. For example, if we wish to discuss some aspect of a proposed modification to Lisp with another member of the Lisp community, we can supply an evaluator that embodies the change. The recipient can then experiment with the new evaluator and send back comments as further modifications. Not only does the high-level implementation base make it easier to test and debug the evaluator; in addition, the embedding enables the designer to snarf^[Snarf: “To grab, especially a large document or file for the purpose of using it either with or without the owner’s permission.” Snarf down: “To snarf, sometimes with the connotation of absorbing, processing, or understanding.” (These definitions were snarfed from [Steele et al. 1983](References.xhtml#Steele-et-al_002e-1983). See also [Raymond 1993](References.xhtml#Raymond-1993).)] features from the underlying language, just as our embedded Lisp evaluator uses primitives and control structure from the underlying Lisp. Only later (if ever) need the designer go to the trouble of building a complete implementation in a low-level language or in hardware. In this section and the next we explore some variations on Scheme that provide significant additional expressive power.\n",

    "\n",
    "In [1.1](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1), where we began our discussion of models of evaluation, we noted that Scheme is an *applicative-order* language, namely, that all the arguments to Scheme procedures are evaluated when the procedure is applied. In contrast, *normal-order* languages delay evaluation of procedure arguments until the actual argument values are needed. Delaying evaluation of procedure arguments until the last possible moment (e.g., until they are required by a primitive operation) is called *lazy evaluation*.^[The difference between the “lazy” terminology and the “normal-order” terminology is somewhat fuzzy. Generally, “lazy” refers to the mechanisms of particular evaluators, while “normal-order” refers to the semantics of languages, independent of any particular evaluation strategy. But this is not a hard-and-fast distinction, and the two terminologies are often used interchangeably.] Consider the procedure"

An advantage of lazy evaluation is that some procedures, such as `unless`, can do useful computation even if evaluation of some of their arguments would produce errors or would not terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the body of a procedure is entered before an argument has been evaluated we say that the procedure is *non-strict* in that argument. If the argument is evaluated before the body of the procedure is entered we say that the procedure is *strict* in that argument.^[The “strict” versus “non-strict” terminology means essentially the same thing as “applicative-order” versus “normal-order,” except that it refers to individual procedures and arguments rather than to the language as a whole. At a conference on programming languages you might hear someone say, “The normal-order language Hassle has certain strict primitives. Other procedures take their arguments by lazy evaluation.”] In a purely applicative-order language, all procedures are strict in each argument. In a purely normal-order language, all compound procedures are non-strict in each argument, and primitive procedures may be either strict or non-strict. There are also languages (see [Exercise 4.31](#Exercise-4_002e31)) that give programmers detailed control over the strictness of the procedures they define.\n",
    "\n",
    "A striking example of a procedure that can usefully be made non-strict is `cons` (or, in general, almost any constructor for data structures). One can do useful computation, combining elements to form data structures and operating on the resulting data structures, even if the values of the elements are not known. It makes perfect sense, for instance, to compute the length of a list without knowing the values of the individual elements in the list. We will exploit this idea in [4.2.3](#g_t4_002e2_002e3) to implement the streams of [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) as lists formed of non-strict `cons` pairs.\n",

    "## 4.2.2 An Interpreter with Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will implement a normal-order language that is the same as Scheme except that compound procedures are non-strict in each argument. Primitive procedures will still be strict. It is not difficult to modify the evaluator of [4.1.1](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e1) so that the language it interprets behaves this way. Almost all the required changes center around procedure application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that, when applying a procedure, the interpreter must determine which arguments are to be evaluated and which are to be delayed. The delayed arguments are not evaluated; instead, they are transformed into objects called *thunks*.^[The word *thunk* was invented by an informal working group that was discussing the implementation of call-by-name in Algol 60. They observed that most of the analysis of (“thinking about”) the expression could be done at compile time; thus, at run time, the expression would already have been “thunk” about ([Ingerman et al. 1960](References.xhtml#Ingerman-et-al_002e-1960)).] The thunk must contain the information required to produce the value of the argument when it is needed, as if it had been evaluated at the time of the application. Thus, the thunk must contain the argument expression and the environment in which the procedure application is being evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of evaluating the expression in a thunk is called *forcing*.^[This is analogous to the use of `force` on the delayed objects that were introduced in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) to represent streams. The critical difference between what we are doing here and what we did in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) is that we are building delaying and forcing into the evaluator, and thus making this uniform and automatic throughout the language.] In general, a thunk will be forced only when its value is needed: when it is passed to a primitive procedure that will use the value of the thunk; when it is the value of a predicate of a conditional; and when it is the value of an operator that is about to be applied as a procedure. One design choice we have available is whether or not to *memoize* thunks, as we did with delayed objects in [3.5.1](3_002e5.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e1). With memoization, the first time a thunk is forced, it stores the value that is computed. Subsequent forcings simply return the stored value without repeating the computation. We’ll make our interpreter memoize, because this is more efficient for many applications. There are tricky considerations here, however.^[Lazy evaluation combined with memoization is sometimes referred to as *call-by-need* argument passing, in contrast to *call-by-name* argument passing. (Call-by-name, introduced in Algol 60, is similar to non-memoized lazy evaluation.) As language designers, we can build our evaluator to memoize, not to memoize, or leave this an option for programmers ([Exercise 4.31](#Exercise-4_002e31)). As you might expect from [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3), these choices raise issues that become both subtle and confusing in the presence of assignments. (See [Exercise 4.27](#Exercise-4_002e27) and [Exercise 4.29](#Exercise-4_002e29).) An excellent article by [Clinger (1982)](References.xhtml#Clinger-_00281982_0029) attempts to clarify the multiple dimensions of confusion that arise here.]\n",

Cy thus thinks that when evaluating sequences, we must force all expressions in the sequence except the final one.

Design and implement the changes required to produce such an extension to Scheme. You will have to implement new syntax procedures to handle the new syntax for `define`.

    "## 4.2.3 Streams as Lazy Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3.5.1](3_002e5.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e1), we showed how to implement streams as delayed lists. We introduced special forms `delay` and `cons-stream`, which allowed us to construct a “promise” to compute the `cdr` of a stream, without actually fulfilling that promise until later. We could use this general technique of introducing special forms whenever we need more control over the evaluation process, but this is awkward. For one thing, a special form is not a first-class object like a procedure, so we cannot use it together with higher-order procedures.^[This is precisely the issue with the `unless` procedure, as in [Exercise 4.26](#Exercise-4_002e26).] Additionally, we were forced to create streams as a new kind of data object similar but not identical to lists, and this required us to reimplement many ordinary list operations (`map`, `append`, and so on) for use with streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "With lazy evaluation, streams and lists can be identical, so there is no need for special forms or for separate list and stream operations. All we need to do is to arrange matters so that `cons` is non-strict. One way to accomplish this is to extend the lazy evaluator to allow for non-strict primitives, and to implement `cons` as one of these. An easier way is to recall ([2.1.3](2_002e1.xhtml#g_t2_002e1_002e3)) that there is no fundamental need to implement `cons` as a primitive at all. Instead, we can represent pairs as procedures:^[This is the procedural representation described in [Exercise 2.4](2_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-2_002e4). Essentially any procedural representation (e.g., a message-passing implementation) would do as well. Notice that we can install these definitions in the lazy evaluator simply by typing them at the driver loop. If we had originally included `cons`, `car`, and `cdr` as primitives in the global environment, they will be redefined. (Also see [Exercise 4.33](#Exercise-4_002e33) and [Exercise 4.34](#Exercise-4_002e34).)]"
