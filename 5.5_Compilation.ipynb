    "The explicit-control evaluator of [5.4](5_002e4.xhtml#g_t5_002e4) is a register machine whose controller interprets Scheme programs. In this section we will see how to run Scheme programs on a register machine whose controller is not a Scheme interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explicit-control evaluator machine is universal—it can carry out any computational process that can be described in Scheme. The evaluator’s controller orchestrates the use of its data paths to perform the desired computation. Thus, the evaluator’s data paths are universal: They are sufficient to perform any computation we desire, given an appropriate controller.^[This is a theoretical statement. We are not claiming that the evaluator’s data paths are a particularly convenient or efficient set of data paths for a general-purpose computer. For example, they are not very good for implementing high-performance floating-point calculations or calculations that intensively manipulate bit vectors.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial general-purpose computers are register machines organized around a collection of registers and operations that constitute an efficient and convenient universal set of data paths. The controller for a general-purpose machine is an interpreter for a register-machine language like the one we have been using. This language is called the *native language* of the machine, or simply *machine language*. Programs written in machine language are sequences of instructions that use the machine’s data paths. For example, the explicit-control evaluator’s instruction sequence can be thought of as a machine-language program for a general-purpose computer rather than as the controller for a specialized interpreter machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common strategies for bridging the gap between higher-level languages and register-machine languages. The explicit-control evaluator illustrates the strategy of interpretation. An interpreter written in the native language of a machine configures the machine to execute programs written in a language (called the *source language*) that may differ from the native language of the machine performing the evaluation. The primitive procedures of the source language are implemented as a library of subroutines written in the native language of the given machine. A program to be interpreted (called the *source program*) is represented as a data structure. The interpreter traverses this data structure, analyzing the source program. As it does so, it simulates the intended behavior of the source program by calling appropriate primitive subroutines from the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore the alternative strategy of *compilation*. A compiler for a given source language and machine translates a source program into an equivalent program (called the *object program*) written in the machine’s native language. The compiler that we implement in this section translates programs written in Scheme into sequences of instructions to be executed using the explicit-control evaluator machine’s data paths.^[Actually, the machine that runs compiled code can be simpler than the interpreter machine, because we won’t use the `exp` and `unev` registers. The interpreter used these to hold pieces of unevaluated expressions. With the compiler, however, these expressions get built into the compiled code that the register machine will run. For the same reason, we don’t need the machine operations that deal with expression syntax. But compiled code will use a few additional machine operations (to represent compiled procedure objects) that didn’t appear in the explicit-control evaluator machine.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with interpretation, compilation can provide a great increase in the efficiency of program execution, as we will explain below in the overview of the compiler. On the other hand, an interpreter provides a more powerful environment for interactive program development and debugging, because the source program being executed is available at run time to be examined and modified. In addition, because the entire library of primitives is present, new programs can be constructed and added to the system during debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of the complementary advantages of compilation and interpretation, modern program-development environments pursue a mixed strategy. Lisp interpreters are generally organized so that interpreted procedures and compiled procedures can call each other. This enables a programmer to compile those parts of a program that are assumed to be debugged, thus gaining the efficiency advantage of compilation, while retaining the interpretive mode of execution for those parts of the program that are in the flux of interactive development and debugging. In [5.5.7](#g_t5_002e5_002e7), after we have implemented the compiler, we will show how to interface it with our interpreter to produce an integrated interpreter-compiler development system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### An overview of the compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "Our compiler is much like our interpreter, both in its structure and in the function it performs. Accordingly, the mechanisms used by the compiler for analyzing expressions will be similar to those used by the interpreter. Moreover, to make it easy to interface compiled and interpreted code, we will design the compiler to generate code that obeys the same conventions of register usage as the interpreter: The environment will be kept in the `env` register, argument lists will be accumulated in `argl`, a procedure to be applied will be in `proc`, procedures will return their answers in `val`, and the location to which a procedure should return will be kept in `continue`. In general, the compiler translates a source program into an object program that performs essentially the same register operations as would the interpreter in evaluating the same source program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This description suggests a strategy for implementing a rudimentary compiler: We traverse the expression in the same way the interpreter does. When we encounter a register instruction that the interpreter would perform in evaluating the expression, we do not execute the instruction but instead accumulate it into a sequence. The resulting sequence of instructions will be the object code. Observe the efficiency advantage of compilation over interpretation. Each time the interpreter evaluates an expression—for example, `(f 84 96)`—it performs the work of classifying the expression (discovering that this is a procedure application) and testing for the end of the operand list (discovering that there are two operands). With a compiler, the expression is analyzed only once, when the instruction sequence is generated at compile time. The object code produced by the compiler contains only the instructions that evaluate the operator and the two operands, assemble the argument list, and apply the procedure (in `proc`) to the arguments (in `argl`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same kind of optimization we implemented in the analyzing evaluator of [4.1.7](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e7). But there are further opportunities to gain efficiency in compiled code. As the interpreter runs, it follows a process that must be applicable to any expression in the language. In contrast, a given segment of compiled code is meant to execute some particular expression. This can make a big difference, for example in the use of the stack to save registers. When the interpreter evaluates an expression, it must be prepared for any contingency. Before evaluating a subexpression, the interpreter saves all registers that will be needed later, because the subexpression might require an arbitrary evaluation. A compiler, on the other hand, can exploit the structure of the particular expression it is processing to generate code that avoids unnecessary stack operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a case in point, consider the combination `(f 84 96)`. Before the interpreter evaluates the operator of the combination, it prepares for this evaluation by saving the registers containing the operands and the environment, whose values will be needed later. The interpreter then evaluates the operator to obtain the result in `val`, restores the saved registers, and finally moves the result from `val` to `proc`. However, in the particular expression we are dealing with, the operator is the symbol `f`, whose evaluation is accomplished by the machine operation `lookup-variable-value`, which does not alter any registers. The compiler that we implement in this section will take advantage of this fact and generate code that evaluates the operator using the instruction"

Having analyzed the code, the compiler can in many cases know in which frame a particular variable will be located and access that frame directly, rather than performing the `lookup-variable-value` search. We will discuss how to implement such variable access in [5.5.6](#g_t5_002e5_002e6). Until then, however, we will focus on the kind of register and stack optimizations described above. There are many other optimizations that can be performed by a compiler, such as coding primitive operations “in line” instead of using a general `apply` mechanism (see [Exercise 5.38](#Exercise-5_002e38)); but we will not emphasize these here. Our main goal in this section is to illustrate the compilation process in a simplified (but still interesting) context.\n",

    "In [4.1.7](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e7) we modified our original metacircular interpreter to separate analysis from execution.

The compiler, like the interpreters, uses the expression-syntax procedures defined in [4.1.2](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e2).^[Notice, however, that our compiler is a Scheme program, and the syntax procedures that it uses to manipulate expressions are the actual Scheme procedures used with the metacircular evaluator. For the explicit-control evaluator, in contrast, we assumed that equivalent syntax operations were available as operations for the register machine. (Of course, when we simulated the register machine in Scheme, we used the actual Scheme procedures in our register machine simulation.)] `Compile` performs a case analysis on the syntactic type of the expression to be compiled.

    "Whenever registers might need to be saved, the compiler’s code generators use `preserving`, which is a more subtle method for combining instruction sequences. `Preserving` takes three arguments: a set of registers and two instruction sequences that are to be executed sequentially. It appends the sequences in such a way that the contents of each register in the set is preserved over the execution of the first sequence, if this is needed for the execution of the second sequence. That is, if the first sequence modifies the register and the second sequence actually needs the register’s original contents, then `preserving` wraps a `save` and a `restore` of the register around the first sequence before appending the sequences. Otherwise, `preserving` simply returns the appended instruction sequences.

The compiler uses the procedure `make-label` to generate labels. `Make-label` takes a symbol as argument and returns a new symbol that begins with the given symbol. For example, successive calls to `(make-label 'a)` would return `a1`, `a2`, and so on. `Make-label` can be implemented similarly to the generation of unique variable names in the query language, as follows:] In this arrangement of code, we must branch around the true branch if the test is false. The only slight complication is in how the linkage for the true branch should be handled. If the linkage for the conditional is `return` or a label, then the true and false branches will both use this same linkage.

    "Suppose instead that we had handled the case of a procedure call with a linkage of `return` and a target of `val` as shown above for a non-`val` target. This would destroy tail recursion. Our system would still give the same value for any expression. But each time we called a procedure, we would save `continue` and return after the call to undo the (useless) save. These extra saves would accumulate during a nest of procedure calls.^[Making a compiler generate tail-recursive code might seem like a straightforward idea. But most compilers for common languages, including C and Pascal, do not do this, and therefore these languages cannot represent iterative processes in terms of procedure call alone. The difficulty with tail recursion in these languages is that their implementations use the stack to store procedure arguments and local variables as well as return addresses. The Scheme implementations described in this book store arguments and variables in memory to be garbage-collected. The reason for using the stack for variables and arguments is that it avoids the need for garbage collection in languages that would not otherwise require it, and is generally believed to be more efficient. Sophisticated Lisp compilers can, in fact, use the stack for arguments without destroying tail recursion. (See [Hanson 1990](References.xhtml#Hanson-1990) for a description.) There is also some debate about whether stack allocation is actually more efficient than garbage collection in the first place, but the details seem to hinge on fine points of computer architecture. (See [Appel 1987](References.xhtml#Appel-1987) and [Miller and Rozas 1994](References.xhtml#Miller-and-Rozas-1994) for opposing views on this issue.)]\n",

    "`Preserving`, the second major instruction sequence combiner, takes a list of registers `regs` and two instruction sequences `seq1` and `seq2` that are to be executed sequentially. It returns an instruction sequence whose statements are the statements of `seq1` followed by the statements of `seq2`, with appropriate `save` and `restore` instructions around `seq1` to protect the registers in `regs` that are modified by `seq1` but needed by `seq2`. To accomplish this, `preserving` first creates a sequence that has the required `save`s followed by the statements of `seq1` followed by the required `restore`s. This sequence needs the registers being saved and restored in addition to the registers needed by `seq1`, and modifies the registers modified by `seq1` except for the ones being saved and restored. This augmented sequence and `seq2` are then appended in the usual way. The following procedure implements this strategy recursively, walking down the list of registers to be preserved:^[Note that `preserving` calls `append` with three arguments. Though the definition of `append` shown in this book accepts only two arguments, Scheme standardly provides an `append` procedure that takes an arbitrary number of arguments.]"

The compiler always generates code to perform the test, as well as code for primitive and compound branches (only one of which will be executed). We have not shown the part of the controller that implements primitives, but we presume that these instructions make use of primitive arithmetic operations in the machine’s data paths. Consider how much less code would be generated if the compiler could *open-code* primitives—that is, if it could generate code to directly use these primitive machine operations. The expression `(+ a 1)` might be compiled into something as simple as^[We have used the same symbol `+` here to denote both the source-language procedure and the machine operation.

Moreover, if we add reserved words to a compiler that is in use, existing programs that define procedures with these names will stop working.

Our compiler, as we have implemented it so far, generates code that uses the `lookup-variable-value` operation of the evaluator machine. This searches for a variable by comparing it with each variable that is currently bound, working frame by frame outward through the run-time environment. This search can be expensive if the frames are deeply nested or if there are many variables.

We will assume, for the moment, that our programs do not use `define`—that variables are bound only with `lambda`. Because our language is lexically scoped, the run-time environment for any expression will have a structure that parallels the lexical structure of the program in which the expression appears.^[This is not true if we allow internal definitions, unless we scan them out. See [Exercise 5.43](#Exercise-5_002e43).] Thus, the compiler can know, when it analyzes the above expression, that each time the procedure is applied the variable `x` in `(* x y z)` will be found two frames out from the current frame and will be the first variable in that frame.\n",

If we add the `lexical-address-lookup` operation to our machine, we can make the compiler generate code that references variables using this operation, rather than `lookup-variable-value`. Similarly, our compiled code can use a new `lexical-address-set!` operation instead of `set-variable-value!`.\n",

The lexical address of a variable in a program depends on where one is in the code.

At that point `y` is at address (0, 0) and `c` is at address (1, 2). In expression `⟨`e2`⟩`, `x` is at (1, 0), `y` is at (1, 1), and `c` is at (0, 2)."

The compile-time environment is a list of frames, each containing a list of variables. (There will of course be no values bound to the variables, since values are not computed at compile time.) The compile-time environment becomes an additional argument to `compile` and is passed along to each code generator. The top-level call to `compile` uses an empty compile-time environment. When a `lambda` body is compiled, `compile-lambda-body` extends the compile-time environment by a frame containing the procedure’s parameters, so that the sequence making up the body is compiled with that extended environment.

(The only place a variable that is not found at compile time can be is in the global environment, which is part of the run-time environment but is not part of the compile-time environment.^[Lexical addresses cannot be used to access variables in the global environment, because these names can be defined and redefined interactively at any time. With internal definitions scanned out, as in [Exercise 5.43](#Exercise-5_002e43), the only definitions the compiler sees are those at top level, which act on the global environment. Compilation of a definition does not cause the defined name to be entered in the compile-time environment.] Thus, if you wish, you may have the evaluator operations look directly in the global environment, which can be obtained with the operation `(op get-global-environment)`, instead of having them search the whole run-time environment found in `env`.) Test the modified compiler on a few simple cases, such as the nested `lambda` combination at the beginning of this section.\n",

Rather, a procedure body should be interpreted as if the internal variables being defined were installed as ordinary `lambda` variables initialized to their correct values using `set!`. [4.1.6](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e6) and [Exercise 4.16](4_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-4_002e16) showed how to modify the metacircular interpreter to accomplish this by scanning out internal definitions.

Our implementation treated the names of open-coded procedures as reserved words. If a program were to rebind such a name, the mechanism described in [Exercise 5.38](#Exercise-5_002e38) would still open-code it as a primitive, ignoring the new binding.

See [Exercise 5.47](#Exercise-5_002e47).] An interpreter raises the machine to the level of the user program; a compiler lowers the user program to the level of the machine language. We can regard the Scheme language (or any programming language) as a coherent family of abstractions erected on the machine language. Interpreters are good for interactive program development and debugging because the steps of program execution are organized in terms of these abstractions, and are therefore more intelligible to the programmer. Compiled code can execute faster, because the steps of program execution are organized in terms of the machine language, and the compiler is free to make optimizations that cut across the higher-level abstractions.^[Independent of the strategy of execution, we incur significant overhead if we insist that errors encountered in execution of a user program be detected and signaled, rather than being allowed to kill the system or produce wrong answers. For example, an out-of-bounds array reference can be detected by checking the validity of the reference before performing it. The overhead of checking, however, can be many times the cost of the array reference itself, and a programmer should weigh speed against safety in determining whether such a check is desirable. A good compiler should be able to produce code with such checks, should avoid redundant checks, and should allow programmers to control the extent and type of error checking in the compiled code.]\n",

    "The alternatives of interpretation and compilation also lead to different strategies for porting languages to new computers. Suppose that we wish to implement Lisp for a new machine. One strategy is to begin with the explicit-control evaluator of [5.4](5_002e4.xhtml#g_t5_002e4) and translate its instructions to instructions for the new machine. A different strategy is to begin with the compiler and change the code generators so that they generate code for the new machine. The second strategy allows us to run any Lisp program on the new machine by first compiling it with the compiler running on our original Lisp system, and linking it with a compiled version of the run-time library.^[Of course, with either the interpretation or the compilation strategy we must also implement for the new machine storage allocation, input and output, and all the various operations that we took as “primitive” in our discussion of the evaluator and compiler. One strategy for minimizing work here is to write as many of these operations as possible in Lisp and then compile them for the new machine. Ultimately, everything reduces to a small kernel (such as garbage collection and the mechanism for applying actual machine primitives) that is hand-coded for the new machine.] Better yet, we can compile the compiler itself, and run this on the new machine to compile other Lisp programs.^[This strategy leads to amusing tests of correctness of the compiler, such as checking whether the compilation of a program on the new machine, using the compiled compiler, is identical with the compilation of the program on the original Lisp system. Tracking down the source of differences is fun but often frustrating, because the results are extremely sensitive to minuscule details.] Or we can compile one of the interpreters of [4.1](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1) to produce an interpreter that runs on the new machine.\n",
