    "We’ve gained a good understanding of assignment as a tool in modeling, as well as an appreciation of the complex problems that assignment raises. It is time to ask whether we could have gone about things in a different way, so as to avoid some of these problems. In this section, we explore an alternative approach to modeling state, based on data structures called *streams*. As we shall see, streams can mitigate some of the complexity of modeling state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s step back and review where this complexity comes from. In an attempt to model real-world phenomena, we made some apparently reasonable decisions: We modeled real-world objects with local state by computational objects with local variables. We identified time variation in the real world with time variation in the computer. We implemented the time variation of the states of the model objects in the computer with assignments to the local variables of the model objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there another approach? Can we avoid identifying time in the computer with time in the modeled world? Must we make the model change with time in order to model phenomena in a changing world? Think about the issue in terms of mathematical functions. We can describe the time-varying behavior of a quantity $x$ as a function of time $x(t)$. If we concentrate on $x$ instant by instant, we think of it as a changing quantity. Yet if we concentrate on the entire time history of values, we do not emphasize change—the function itself does not change.^[Physicists sometimes adopt this view by introducing the “world lines” of particles as a device for reasoning about motion. We’ve also already mentioned ([2.2.3](2_002e2.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e3)) that this is the natural way to think about signal-processing systems. We will explore applications of streams to signal processing in [3.5.3](#g_t3_002e5_002e3).]\n",
    "\n",
    "If time is measured in discrete steps, then we can model a time function as a (possibly infinite) sequence. In this section, we will see how to model change in terms of sequences that represent the time histories of the systems being modeled. To accomplish this, we introduce new data structures called *streams*. From an abstract point of view, a stream is simply a sequence. However, we will find that the straightforward implementation of streams as lists (as in [2.2.1](2_002e2.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e1)) doesn’t fully reveal the power of stream processing. As an alternative, we introduce the technique of *delayed evaluation*, which enables us to represent very large (even infinite) sequences as streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream processing lets us model systems that have state without ever using assignment or mutable data. This has important implications, both theoretical and practical, because we can build models that avoid the drawbacks inherent in introducing assignment. On the other hand, the stream framework raises difficulties of its own, and the question of which modeling technique leads to more modular and more easily maintained systems remains open.\n",

    "As we saw in [2.2.3](2_002e2.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e3), sequences can serve as standard interfaces for combining program modules. We formulated powerful abstractions for manipulating sequences, such as `map`, `filter`, and `accumulate`, that capture a wide variety of operations in a manner that is both succinct and elegant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, if we represent sequences as lists, this elegance is bought at the price of severe inefficiency with respect to both the time and space required by our computations. When we represent manipulations on sequences as transformations of lists, our programs must construct and copy data structures (which may be huge) at every step of a process.\n",
    "\n",

The first program is written in standard iterative style:^[Assume that we have a predicate `prime?` (e.g., as in [1.2.6](1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2_002e6)) that tests for primality.]"

    "Streams are a clever idea that allows one to use sequence manipulations without incurring the costs of manipulating sequences as lists. With streams we can achieve the best of both worlds: We can formulate programs elegantly as sequence manipulations, while attaining the efficiency of incremental computation. The basic idea is to arrange to construct a stream only partially, and to pass the partial construction to the program that consumes the stream. If the consumer attempts to access a part of the stream that has not yet been constructed, the stream will automatically construct just enough more of itself to produce the required part, thus preserving the illusion that the entire stream exists. In other words, although we will write programs as if we were processing complete sequences, we design our stream implementation to automatically and transparently interleave the construction of the stream with its use.\n",

The fact that we are defining such similar procedures for streams and lists indicates that we are missing some underlying abstraction.

    "To make the stream implementation automatically and transparently interleave the construction of a stream with its use, we will arrange for the `cdr` of a stream to be evaluated when it is accessed by the `stream-cdr` procedure rather than when the stream is constructed by `cons-stream`. This implementation choice is reminiscent of our discussion of rational numbers in [2.1.2](2_002e1.xhtml#g_t2_002e1_002e2), where we saw that we can choose to implement rational numbers so that the reduction of numerator and denominator to lowest terms is performed either at construction time or at selection time. The two rational-number implementations produce the same data abstraction, but the choice has an effect on efficiency. There is a similar relationship between streams and ordinary lists. As a data abstraction, streams are the same as lists. The difference is the time at which the elements are evaluated. With ordinary lists, both the `car` and the `cdr` are evaluated at construction time. With streams, the `cdr` is evaluated at selection time.\n",

As a companion to `delay`, there is a procedure called `force` that takes a delayed object as argument and performs the evaluation—in effect, forcing the `delay` to fulfill its promise. We will see below how `delay` and `force` can be implemented, but first let us use these to construct streams.\n",

    "This implementation suffices for `delay` and `force` to work as advertised, but there is an important optimization that we can include. In many applications, we end up forcing the same delayed object many times. This can lead to serious inefficiency in recursive programs involving streams. (See [Exercise 3.57](#Exercise-3_002e57).) The solution is to build delayed objects so that the first time they are forced, they store the value that is computed. Subsequent forcings will simply return the stored value without repeating the computation. In other words, we implement `delay` as a special-purpose memoized procedure similar to the one described in [Exercise 3.27](3_002e3.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e27). One way to accomplish this is to use the following procedure, which takes as argument a procedure (of no arguments) and returns a memoized version of the procedure. The first time the memoized procedure is run, it saves the computed result. On subsequent evaluations, it simply returns the result."

The use of this mechanism to implement streams was first described by [Landin (1965)](References.xhtml#Landin-_00281965_0029). Delayed evaluation for streams was introduced into Lisp by [Friedman and Wise (1976)](References.xhtml#Friedman-and-Wise-_00281976_0029). In their implementation, `cons` always delays evaluating its arguments, so that lists automatically behave as streams. The memoizing optimization is also known as *call-by-need*. The Algol community would refer to our original delayed objects as *call-by-name thunks* and to the optimized versions as *call-by-need thunks*.]\n",

On the other hand, intermixing delayed evaluation with printing—and, even worse, with assignment—is extremely confusing, and instructors of courses on computer languages have traditionally tormented their students with examination questions such as the ones in this section. Needless to say, writing programs that depend on such subtleties is odious programming style.

Alexandrian Greek philosopher, is famous for giving the first accurate estimate of the circumference of the Earth, which he computed by observing shadows cast at noon on the day of the summer solstice. Eratosthenes’s sieve method, although ancient, has formed the basis for special-purpose hardware “sieves” that, until recently, were the most powerful tools in existence for locating large primes. Since the 70s, however, these methods have been superseded by outgrowths of the probabilistic techniques discussed in [1.2.6](1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2_002e6).] We start with the integers beginning with 2, which is the first prime. To get the rest of the primes, we start by filtering the multiples of 2 from the rest of the integers. This leaves a stream beginning with 3, which is the next prime. Now we filter the multiples of 3 from the rest of this stream. This leaves a stream beginning with 5, which is the next prime, and so on. In other words, we construct the primes by a sieving process, described as follows: To sieve a stream `S`, form a stream whose first element is the first element of `S` and the rest of which is obtained by filtering all multiples of the first element of `S` out of the rest of `S` and sieving the result.

The first element is used to construct a divisibility filter, through which the rest is passed, and the output of the filter is fed to another sieve box.

    "This is a recursive definition, since `primes` is defined in terms of the `prime?` predicate, which itself uses the `primes` stream. The reason this procedure works is that, at any point, enough of the `primes` stream has been generated to test the primality of the numbers we need to check next. That is, for every $n$ we test for primality, either $n$ is not prime (in which case there is a prime already generated that divides it) or $n$ is prime (in which case there is a prime already generated—i.e., a prime less than $n$—that is greater than $\\sqrt{n}$).^[This last point is very subtle and relies on the fact that ${p_{n + 1} \\leq p_{n}^{2}}.$ (Here, $p_{k}$ denotes the $k^{\\text{th}}$ prime.) Estimates such as these are very difficult to establish. The ancient proof by Euclid that there are an infinite number of primes shows that $p_{n + 1} \\leq {p_{1}p_{2}\\cdots p_{n} + 1}$, and no substantially better result was proved until 1851, when the Russian mathematician P. L. Chebyshev established that $p_{n + 1} \\leq 2p_{n}$ for all $n$. This result, originally conjectured in 1845, is known as *Bertrand’s hypothesis*.

I had ridden in taxi-cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to me a rather dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.’ ” The trick of using weighted pairs to generate the Ramanujan numbers was shown to us by Charles Leiserson.] Ordered streams of pairs provide an elegant solution to the problem of computing these numbers. To find a number that can be written as the sum of two cubes in two different ways, we need only generate the stream of pairs of integers $(i,j)$ weighted according to the sum $i^{3} + j^{3}$ (see [Exercise 3.70](#Exercise-3_002e70)), then search the stream for two consecutive pairs with the same weight.

    "\n",
    "The examples in this section illustrate how the explicit use of `delay` and `force` provides great programming flexibility, but the same examples also show how this can make our programs more complex. Our new `integral` procedure, for instance, gives us the power to model systems with loops, but we must now remember that `integral` should be called with a delayed integrand, and every procedure that uses `integral` must be aware of this. In effect, we have created two classes of procedures: ordinary procedures and procedures that take delayed arguments. In general, creating separate classes of procedures forces us to create separate classes of higher-order procedures as well.^[This is a small reflection, in Lisp, of the difficulties that conventional strongly typed languages such as Pascal have in coping with higher-order procedures. In such languages, the programmer must specify the data types of the arguments and the result of each procedure: number, logical value, sequence, and so on. Consequently, we could not express an abstraction such as “map a given procedure `proc` over all the elements in a sequence” by a single higher-order procedure such as `stream-map`. Rather, we would need a different mapping procedure for each different combination of argument and result data types that might be specified for a `proc`. Maintaining a practical notion of “data type” in the presence of higher-order procedures raises many difficult issues. One way of dealing with this problem is illustrated by the language ML ([Gordon et al. 1979](References.xhtml#Gordon-et-al_002e-1979)), whose “polymorphic data types” include templates for higher-order transformations between data types. Moreover, data types for most procedures in ML are never explicitly declared by the programmer. Instead, ML includes a *type-inferencing* mechanism that uses information in the environment to deduce the data types for newly defined procedures.]\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to avoid the need for two different classes of procedures is to make all procedures take delayed arguments. We could adopt a model of evaluation in which all arguments to procedures are automatically delayed and arguments are forced only when they are actually needed (for example, when they are required by a primitive operation). This would transform our language to use normal-order evaluation, which we first described when we introduced the substitution model for evaluation in [1.1.5](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e5). Converting to normal-order evaluation provides a uniform and elegant way to simplify the use of delayed evaluation, and this would be a natural strategy to adopt if we were concerned only with stream processing. In [4.2](4_002e2.xhtml#g_t4_002e2), after we have studied the evaluator, we will see how to transform our language in just this way. Unfortunately, including delays in procedure calls wreaks havoc with our ability to design programs that depend on the order of events, such as programs that use assignment, mutate data, or perform input or output. Even the single `delay` in `cons-stream` can cause great confusion, as illustrated by [Exercise 3.51](#Exercise-3_002e51) and [Exercise 3.52](#Exercise-3_002e52). As far as anyone knows, mutability and delayed evaluation do not mix well in programming languages, and devising ways to deal with both of these at once is an active area of research.\n",

Stream models can provide an equivalent modularity without the use of assignment.

We introduced assignment and mutable objects to provide a mechanism for modular construction of programs that model systems with state. We constructed computational objects with local state variables and used assignment to modify these variables. We modeled the temporal behavior of the objects in the world by the temporal behavior of the corresponding computational objects.\n",

We can model a changing quantity, such as the local state of some object, using a stream that represents the time history of successive states.

Indeed, because of the presence of `delay` there may be little relation between simulated time in the model and the order of events during the evaluation.\n",

    "`Stream-withdraw` implements a well-defined mathematical function whose output is fully determined by its input. Suppose, however, that the input `amount-stream` is the stream of successive values typed by the user and that the resulting stream of balances is displayed. Then, from the perspective of the user who is typing values and watching results, the stream process has the same behavior as the object created by `make-simplified-withdraw`. However, with the stream version, there is no assignment, no local state variable, and consequently none of the theoretical difficulties that we encountered in [3.1.3](3_002e1.xhtml#g_t3_002e1_002e3). Yet the system has state!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really remarkable. Even though `stream-withdraw` implements a well-defined mathematical function whose behavior does not change, the user’s perception here is one of interacting with a system that has a changing state. One way to resolve this paradox is to realize that it is the user’s temporal existence that imposes state on the system. If the user could step back from the interaction and think in terms of streams of balances rather than individual transactions, the system would appear stateless.^[Similarly in physics, when we observe a moving particle, we say that the position (state) of the particle is changing. However, from the perspective of the particle’s world line in space-time there is no change involved.]\n",
    "\n",
    "From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other parts appear to change with time. They have hidden time-varying local state. If we wish to write programs that model this kind of natural decomposition in our world (as we see it from our viewpoint as a part of that world) with structures in our computer, we make computational objects that are not functional—they must change with time. We model state with local state variables, and we model the changes of state with assignments to those variables. By doing this we make the time of execution of a computation model time in the world that we are part of, and thus we get “objects” in our computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling with objects is powerful and intuitive, largely because this matches the perception of interacting with a world of which we are part. However, as we’ve seen repeatedly throughout this chapter, these models raise thorny problems of constraining the order of events and of synchronizing multiple processes. The possibility of avoiding these problems has stimulated the development of *functional programming languages*, which do not include any provision for assignment or mutable data. In such a language, all procedures implement well-defined mathematical functions of their arguments, whose behavior does not change. The functional approach is extremely attractive for dealing with concurrent systems.^[John Backus, the inventor of Fortran, gave high visibility to functional programming when he was awarded the ACM Turing award in 1978. His acceptance speech ([Backus 1978](References.xhtml#Backus-1978)) strongly advocated the functional approach. A good overview of functional programming is given in [Henderson 1980](References.xhtml#Henderson-1980) and in [Darlington et al. 1982](References.xhtml#Darlington-et-al_002e-1982).]\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we look closely, we can see time-related problems creeping into functional models as well. One particularly troublesome area arises when we wish to design interactive systems, especially ones that model interactions between independent entities. For instance, consider once more the implementation of a banking system that permits joint bank accounts. In a conventional system using assignment and objects, we would model the fact that Peter and Paul share an account by having both Peter and Paul send their transaction requests to the same bank-account object, as we saw in [3.1.3](3_002e1.xhtml#g_t3_002e1_002e3). From the stream point of view, where there are no “objects” *per se*, we have already indicated that a bank account can be modeled as a process that operates on a stream of transaction requests to produce a stream of responses. Accordingly, we could model the fact that Peter and Paul have a joint bank account by merging Peter’s stream of transaction requests with Paul’s stream of requests and feeding the result to the bank-account stream process, as shown in [Figure 3.38](#Figure-3_002e38).\n",

    "**Figure 3.38:** A joint bank account, modeled by merging two streams of transaction requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trouble with this formulation is in the notion of *merge*. It will not do to merge the two streams by simply taking alternately one request from Peter and one request from Paul. Suppose Paul accesses the account only very rarely. We could hardly force Peter to wait for Paul to access the account before he could issue a second transaction. However such a merge is implemented, it must interleave the two transaction streams in some way that is constrained by “real time” as perceived by Peter and Paul, in the sense that, if Peter and Paul meet, they can agree that certain transactions were processed before the meeting, and other transactions were processed after the meeting.^[Observe that, for any two streams, there is in general more than one acceptable order of interleaving. Thus, technically, “merge” is a relation rather than a function—the answer is not a deterministic function of the inputs. We already mentioned ([Footnote 167](3_002e4.xhtml#Footnote-167)) that nondeterminism is essential when dealing with concurrency. The merge relation illustrates the same essential nondeterminism, from the functional perspective. In [4.3](4_002e3.xhtml#g_t4_002e3), we will look at nondeterminism from yet another point of view.] This is precisely the same constraint that we had to deal with in [3.4.1](3_002e4.xhtml#g_t3_002e4_002e1), where we found the need to introduce explicit synchronization to ensure a “correct” order of events in concurrent processing of objects with state. Thus, in an attempt to support the functional style, the need to merge inputs from different agents reintroduces the same problems that the functional style was meant to eliminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began this chapter with the goal of building computational models whose structure matches our perception of the real world we are trying to model. We can model the world as a collection of separate, time-bound, interacting objects with state, or we can model the world as a single, timeless, stateless unity. Each view has powerful advantages, but neither view alone is completely satisfactory. A grand unification has yet to emerge.^[The object model approximates the world by dividing it into separate pieces. The functional model does not modularize along object boundaries. The object model is useful when the unshared state of the “objects” is much larger than the state that they share. An example of a place where the object viewpoint fails is quantum mechanics, where thinking of things as individual particles leads to paradoxes and confusions. Unifying the object view with the functional view may have little to do with programming, but rather with fundamental epistemological issues.]"
