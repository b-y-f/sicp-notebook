    "# 1.1 The Elements of Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,\n",
    "- **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and\n",
    "- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. (Later we will discover that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is “stuff” that we want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will deal only with simple numerical data so that we can focus on the rules for building procedures.^[The characterization of numbers as “simple data” is a barefaced bluff. In fact, the treatment of numbers is one of the trickiest and most confusing aspects of any programming language. Some typical issues involved are these: Some computer systems distinguish *integers*, such as 2, from *real numbers*, such as 2.71. Is the real number 2.00 different from the integer 2? Are the arithmetic operations used for integers the same as the operations used for real numbers? Does 6 divided by 2 produce 3, or 3.0? How large a number can we represent? How many decimal places of accuracy can we represent? Is the range of integers the same as the range of real numbers? Above and beyond these questions, of course, lies a collection of issues concerning roundoff and truncation errors—the entire science of numerical analysis. Since our focus in this book is on large-scale program design rather than on numerical techniques, we are going to ignore these problems. The numerical examples in this chapter will exhibit the usual roundoff behavior that one observes when using arithmetic operations that preserve a limited number of decimal places of accuracy in noninteger operations.] In later chapters we will see that these same rules allow us to build procedures to manipulate compound data as well.\n",

    "One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical interactions with an interpreter for the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Imagine that you are sitting at a computer terminal. You type an *expression*, and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its *evaluating* that expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number. (More precisely, the expression that you type consists of the numerals that represent the number in base 10.) If you present Lisp with a number"

    "`Define` is our language’s simplest means of abstraction, for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations, such as the `circumference` computed above. In general, computational objects may have very complex structures, and it would be extremely inconvenient to have to remember and repeat their details each time we want to use them. Indeed, complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity. The interpreter makes this step-by-step program construction particularly convenient because name-object associations can be created incrementally in successive interactions. This feature encourages the incremental development and testing of programs and is largely responsible for the fact that a Lisp program usually consists of a large number of relatively simple procedures.\n",

    "Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes in general. First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus, the evaluation rule is *recursive* in nature; that is, it includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.^[It may seem strange that the evaluation rule says, as part of the first step, that we should evaluate the leftmost element of a combination, since at this point that can only be an operator such as `+` or `*` representing a built-in primitive procedure such as addition or multiplication. We will see later that it is useful to be able to work with combinations whose operators are themselves compound expressions.]\n",

    "requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different combinations. We can obtain a picture of this process by representing the combination in the form of a tree, as shown in [Figure 1.1](#Figure-1_002e1). Each combination is represented by a node with branches corresponding to the operator and the operands of the combination stemming from it. The terminal nodes (that is, nodes with no branches stemming from them) represent either operators or numbers. Viewing evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine that the values of the operands percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and then combining at higher and higher levels. In general, we shall see that recursion is a very powerful technique for dealing with hierarchical, treelike objects. In fact, the “percolate values upward” form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general kind of process known as *tree accumulation*.\n",

    "**Figure 1.1:** Tree representation, showing the value of each subcombination.\n",

    "We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by stipulating that symbols such as `+` and `*` are also included in the global environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine instructions that are their “values.” The key point to notice is the role of the environment in determining the meaning of the symbols in expressions. In an interactive language such as Lisp, it is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as `(+ x 1)` without specifying any information about the environment that would provide a meaning for the symbol `x` (or even for the symbol `+`). As we shall see in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3), the general notion of the environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes place will play an important role in our understanding of program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle definitions. For instance, evaluating `(define x 3)` does not apply `define` to two arguments, one of which is the value of the symbol `x` and the other of which is 3, since the purpose of the `define` is precisely to associate `x` with a value. (That is, `(define x 3)` is not a combination.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called *special forms*. `Define` is the only example of a special form that we have seen so far, but we will meet others shortly. Each special form has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of expressions (each with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the syntax of the programming language. In comparison with most other programming languages, Lisp has a very simple syntax; that is, the evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a simple general rule together with specialized rules for a small number of special forms.^[Special syntactic forms that are simply convenient alternative surface structures for things that can be written in more uniform ways are sometimes called *syntactic sugar*, to use a phrase coined by Peter Landin. In comparison with users of other languages, Lisp programmers, as a rule, are less concerned with matters of syntax. (By contrast, examine any Pascal manual and notice how much of it is devoted to descriptions of syntax.) This disdain for syntax is due partly to the flexibility of Lisp, which makes it easy to change surface syntax, and partly to the observation that many “convenient” syntactic constructs, which make the language less uniform, end up causing more trouble than they are worth when programs become large and complex. In the words of Alan Perlis, “Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.”]\n",

    "The process we have just described is called the *substitution model* for procedure application. It can be taken as a model that determines the “meaning” of procedure application, insofar as the procedures in this chapter are concerned. However, there are two points that should be stressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about procedure application, not to provide a description of how the interpreter really works. Typical interpreters do not evaluate procedure applications by manipulating the text of a procedure to substitute values for the formal parameters. In practice, the “substitution” is accomplished by using a local environment for the formal parameters. We will discuss this more fully in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) and [Chapter 4](Chapter-4.xhtml#Chapter-4) when we examine the implementation of an interpreter in detail.\n",
    "- Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work, culminating with a complete implementation of an interpreter and compiler in [Chapter 5](Chapter-5.xhtml#Chapter-5). The substitution model is only the first of these models—a way to get started thinking formally about the evaluation process. In general, when modeling phenomena in science and engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete models. As we examine things in greater detail, these simple models become inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models. The substitution model is no exception. In particular, when we address in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) the use of procedures with “mutable data,” we will see that the substitution model breaks down and must be replaced by a more complicated model of procedure application.^[Despite the simplicity of the substitution idea, it turns out to be surprisingly complicated to give a rigorous mathematical definition of the substitution process. The problem arises from the possibility of confusion between the names used for the formal parameters of a procedure and the (possibly identical) names used in the expressions to which the procedure may be applied. Indeed, there is a long history of erroneous definitions of *substitution* in the literature of logic and programming semantics. See [Stoy 1977](References.xhtml#Stoy-1977) for a careful discussion of substitution.]\n",

    "According to the description of evaluation given in [1.1.3](#g_t1_002e1_002e3), the interpreter first evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the resulting procedure to the resulting arguments. This is not the only way to perform evaluation. An alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the operands until their values were needed. Instead it would first substitute operand expressions for parameters until it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators, and would then perform the evaluation. If we used this method, the evaluation of `(f 5)` would proceed according to the sequence of expansions"

    "This alternative “fully expand and then reduce” evaluation method is known as *normal-order evaluation*, in contrast to the “evaluate the arguments and then apply” method that the interpreter actually uses, which is called *applicative-order evaluation*. It can be shown that, for procedure applications that can be modeled using substitution (including all the procedures in the first two chapters of this book) and that yield legitimate values, normal-order and applicative-order evaluation produce the same value. (See [Exercise 1.5](#Exercise-1_002e5) for an instance of an “illegitimate” value where normal-order and applicative-order evaluation do not give the same result.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation, partly because of the additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluations of expressions such as those illustrated with `(+ 5 1)` and `(* 5 2)` above and, more significantly, because normal-order evaluation becomes much more complicated to deal with when we leave the realm of procedures that can be modeled by substitution. On the other hand, normal-order evaluation can be an extremely valuable tool, and we will investigate some of its implications in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) and [Chapter 4](Chapter-4.xhtml#Chapter-4).^[In [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) we will introduce *stream processing*, which is a way of handling apparently “infinite” data structures by incorporating a limited form of normal-order evaluation.

When the interpreter checks a predicate’s value, it interprets `#f` as false. Any other value is treated as true. (Thus, providing `#t` is logically unnecessary, but it is convenient.)

In mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usually concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions.^[Declarative and imperative descriptions are intimately related, as indeed are mathematics and computer science. For instance, to say that the answer produced by a program is “correct” is to make a declarative statement about the program. There is a large amount of research aimed at establishing techniques for proving that programs are correct, and much of the technical difficulty of this subject has to do with negotiating the transition between imperative statements (from which programs are constructed) and declarative statements (which can be used to deduce things). In a related vein, an important current area in programming-language design is the exploration of so-called very high-level languages, in which one actually programs in terms of declarative statements. The idea is to make interpreters sophisticated enough so that, given “what is” knowledge specified by the programmer, they can generate “how to” knowledge automatically. This cannot be done in general, but there are important areas where progress has been made. We shall revisit this idea in [Chapter 4](Chapter-4.xhtml#Chapter-4).]\n",

The square-root algorithm itself was developed by Heron of Alexandria in the first century A.D. We will see how to express the general Newton’s method as a Lisp procedure in [1.3.4](1_002e3.xhtml#g_t1_002e3_002e4).] For example, we can compute the square root of 2 as follows.

    "`Sqrt` is our first example of a process defined by a set of mutually defined procedures. Notice that the definition of `sqrt-iter` is *recursive*; that is, the procedure is defined in terms of itself. The idea of being able to define a procedure in terms of itself may be disturbing; it may seem unclear how such a “circular” definition could make sense at all, much less specify a well-defined process to be carried out by a computer. This will be addressed more carefully in [1.2](1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2). But first let’s consider some other important points illustrated by the `sqrt` example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the problem of computing square roots breaks up naturally into a number of subproblems: how to tell whether a guess is good enough, how to improve a guess, and so on. Each of these tasks is accomplished by a separate procedure. The entire `sqrt` program can be viewed as a cluster of procedures (shown in [Figure 1.2](#Figure-1_002e2)) that mirrors the decomposition of the problem into subproblems.\n",

    "The importance of this decomposition strategy is not simply that one is dividing the program into parts. After all, we could take any large program and divide it into parts—the first ten lines, the next ten lines, the next ten lines, and so on. Rather, it is crucial that each procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used as a module in defining other procedures. For example, when we define the `good-enough?` procedure in terms of `square`, we are able to regard the `square` procedure as a “black box.” We are not at that moment concerned with *how* the procedure computes its result, only with the fact that it computes the square. The details of how the square is computed can be suppressed, to be considered at a later time. Indeed, as far as the `good-enough?` procedure is concerned, `square` is not quite a procedure but rather an abstraction of a procedure, a so-called *procedural abstraction*. At this level of abstraction, any procedure that computes the square is equally good.\n",

This depends upon the hardware available. There are machines for which the “obvious” implementation is the less efficient one. Consider a machine that has extensive tables of logarithms and antilogarithms stored in a very efficient manner.]"

    "The intention of the author of `good-enough?` is to determine if the square of the first argument is within a given tolerance of the second argument. We see that the author of `good-enough?` used the name `guess` to refer to the first argument and `x` to refer to the second argument. The argument of `square` is `guess`. If the author of `square` used `x` (as above) to refer to that argument, we see that the `x` in `good-enough?` must be a different `x` than the one in `square`. Running the procedure `square` must not affect the value of `x` that is used by `good-enough?`, because that value of `x` may be needed by `good-enough?` after `square` is done computing.\n",

    "A formal parameter of a procedure has a very special role in the procedure definition, in that it doesn’t matter what name the formal parameter has. Such a name is called a *bound variable*, and we say that the procedure definition *binds* its formal parameters. The meaning of a procedure definition is unchanged if a bound variable is consistently renamed throughout the definition.^[The concept of consistent renaming is actually subtle and difficult to define formally. Famous logicians have made embarrassing errors here.] If a variable is not bound, we say that it is *free*. The set of expressions for which a binding defines a name is called the *scope* of that name. In a procedure definition, the bound variables declared as the formal parameters of the procedure have the body of the procedure as their scope.\n",

    "In the definition of `good-enough?` above, `guess` and `x` are bound variables but `<`, `-`, `abs`, and `square` are free. The meaning of `good-enough?` should be independent of the names we choose for `guess` and `x` so long as they are distinct and different from `<`, `-`, `abs`, and `square`. (If we renamed `guess` to `abs` we would have introduced a bug by *capturing* the variable `abs`. It would have changed from free to bound.) The meaning of `good-enough?` is not independent of the names of its free variables, however. It surely depends upon the fact (external to this definition) that the symbol `abs` names a procedure for computing the absolute value of a number. `Good-enough?` will compute a different function if we substitute `cos` for `abs` in its definition.\n",

    "The problem with this program is that the only procedure that is important to users of `sqrt` is `sqrt`. The other procedures (`sqrt-iter`, `good-enough?`, and `improve`) only clutter up their minds. They may not define any other procedure called `good-enough?` as part of another program to work together with the square-root program, because `sqrt` needs it. The problem is especially severe in the construction of large systems by many separate programmers. For example, in the construction of a large library of numerical procedures, many numerical functions are computed as successive approximations and thus might have procedures named `good-enough?` and `improve` as auxiliary procedures. We would like to localize the subprocedures, hiding them inside `sqrt` so that `sqrt` could coexist with other successive approximations, each having its own private `good-enough?` procedure. To make this possible, we allow a procedure to have internal definitions that are local to that procedure. For example, in the square-root problem we can write"

    "Such nesting of definitions, called *block structure*, is basically the right solution to the simplest name-packaging problem. But there is a better idea lurking here. In addition to internalizing the definitions of the auxiliary procedures, we can simplify them. Since `x` is bound in the definition of `sqrt`, the procedures `good-enough?`, `improve`, and `sqrt-iter`, which are defined internally to `sqrt`, are in the scope of `x`. Thus, it is not necessary to pass `x` explicitly to each of these procedures. Instead, we allow `x` to be a free variable in the internal definitions, as shown below. Then `x` gets its value from the argument with which the enclosing procedure `sqrt` is called. This discipline is called *lexical scoping*.^[Lexical scoping dictates that free variables in a procedure are taken to refer to bindings made by enclosing procedure definitions; that is, they are looked up in the environment in which the procedure was defined. We will see how this works in detail in chapter 3 when we study environments and the detailed behavior of the interpreter.]"
