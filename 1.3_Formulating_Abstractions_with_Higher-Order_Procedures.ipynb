    "# 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that procedures are, in effect, abstractions that describe compound operations on numbers independent of the particular numbers. For example, when we\n",
    "\n",
    "```scheme\n",
    "(define (cube x) (* x x x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we are not talking about the cube of a particular number, but rather about a method for obtaining the cube of any number. Of course we could get along without ever defining this procedure, by always writing expressions such as\n",
    "\n",
    "```scheme\n",
    "(* 3 3 3)\n",
    "(* x x x)\n",
    "(* y y y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and never mentioning `cube` explicitly. This would place us at a serious disadvantage, forcing us to work always at the level of the particular operations that happen to be primitives in the language (multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of higher-level operations. Our programs would be able to compute cubes, but our language would lack the ability to express the concept of cubing. One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly. Procedures provide this ability. This is why all but the most primitive programming languages include mechanisms for defining procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet even in numerical processing we will be severely limited in our ability to create abstractions if we are restricted to procedures whose parameters must be numbers. Often the same programming pattern will be used with a number of different procedures. To express such patterns as concepts, we will need to construct procedures that can accept procedures as arguments or return procedures as values. Procedures that manipulate procedures are called *higher-order procedures*. This section shows how higher-order procedures can serve as powerful abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive power of our language."

Rather than define `pi-next` and `pi-term`, it would be more convenient to have a way to directly specify “the procedure that returns its input incremented by 4” and “the procedure that returns the reciprocal of its input times its input plus 2.” We can do this by introducing the special form `lambda`, which creates procedures.

    "### Finding roots of equations by the half-interval method\n",
    "\n",
    "The *half-interval method* is a simple but powerful technique for finding roots of an equation $f(x) = 0$, where $f$ is a continuous function. The idea is that, if we are given points $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, then $f$ must have at least one zero between $a$ and $b$. To locate a zero, let $x$ be the average of $a$ and $b$, and compute $f(x)$. If $f(x) > 0$, then $f$ must have a zero between $a$ and $x$. If $f(x) < 0$, then $f$ must have a zero between $x$ and $b$. Continuing in this way, we can identify smaller and smaller intervals on which $f$ must have a zero. When we reach a point where the interval is small enough, the process stops. Since the interval of uncertainty is reduced by half at each step of the process, the number of steps required grows as $\\Theta(\\log(L\\,/\\, T))$, where $L$ is the length of the original interval and $T$ is the error tolerance (that is, the size of the interval we will consider “small enough”). Here is a procedure that implements this strategy:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that we are initially given the function $f$ together with points at which its values are negative and positive. We first compute the midpoint of the two given points. Next we check to see if the given interval is small enough, and if so we simply return the midpoint as our answer. Otherwise, we compute as a test value the value of $f$ at the midpoint. If the test value is positive, then we continue the process with a new interval running from the original negative point to the midpoint. If the test value is negative, we continue with the interval from the midpoint to the positive point. Finally, there is the possibility that the test value is 0, in which case the midpoint is itself the root we are searching for.\n",

This is often a very subtle consideration, requiring help from a numerical analyst or some other kind of magician.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Search` is awkward to use directly, because we can accidentally give it points at which $f$’s values do not have the required sign, in which case we get a wrong answer. Instead we will use `search` via the following procedure, which checks to see which of the endpoints has a negative function value and which has a positive value, and calls the `search` procedure accordingly. If the function has the same sign on the two given points, the half-interval method cannot be used, in which case the procedure signals an error.\n",

Then we used average damping to make the approximations converge. Average damping is a useful general technique in itself. Namely, given a function $f$, we consider the function whose value at $x$ is equal to the average of $x$ and $f(x)$.\n",

Applying this resulting procedure to 10 returns the average of 10 and 100, or 55:\n",

[Exercise 1.4](1_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-1_002e4) already demonstrated the ability to form such combinations, but that was only a toy example.

Bear in mind that these procedures express the same process, and notice how much clearer the idea becomes when we express the process in terms of these abstractions. In general, there are many ways to formulate a process as a procedure. Experienced programmers know how to choose procedural formulations that are particularly perspicuous, and where useful elements of the process are exposed as separate entities that can be reused in other applications. As a simple example of reuse, notice that the cube root of $x$ is a fixed point of the function $y\\mapsto x/y^{2}$, so we can immediately generalize our square-root procedure to one that extracts cube roots:\n",

But it is important to be able to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to apply them in new contexts. The significance of higher-order procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements.\n",

The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-damped $y\\mapsto x/y^{2}$. Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots—a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for $y\\mapsto x/y^{3}$ converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of $y\\mapsto x/y^{3}$) the fixed-point search does converge. Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to compute $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of $y\\mapsto x/y^{\\mspace{2mu} n - 1}$. Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots using `fixed-point`, `average-damp`, and the `repeated` procedure of [Exercise 1.43](#Exercise-1_002e43).

    "**Exercise 1.46:** Several of the numerical methods described in this chapter are instances of an extremely general computational strategy known as *iterative improvement*. Iterative improvement says that, to compute something, we start with an initial guess for the answer, test if the guess is good enough, and otherwise improve the guess and continue the process using the improved guess as the new guess. Write a procedure `iterative-improve` that takes two procedures as arguments: a method for telling whether a guess is good enough and a method for improving a guess. `Iterative-improve` should return as its value a procedure that takes a guess as argument and keeps improving the guess until it is good enough. Rewrite the `sqrt` procedure of [1.1.7](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7) and the `fixed-point` procedure of [1.3.3](#g_t1_002e3_002e3) in terms of `iterative-improve`."
