    "# 5.2 A Register-Machine Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gain a good understanding of the design of register machines, we must test the machines we design to see if they perform as expected. One way to test a design is to hand-simulate the operation of the controller, as in [Exercise 5.5](5_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-5_002e5). But this is extremely tedious for all but the simplest machines. In this section we construct a simulator for machines described in the register-machine language. The simulator is a Scheme program with four interface procedures. The first uses a description of a register machine to construct a model of the machine (a data structure whose parts correspond to the parts of the machine to be simulated), and the other three allow us to simulate the machine by manipulating the model:\n",

    "The machine model generated by `make-machine` is represented as a procedure with local state using the message-passing techniques developed in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3). To build this model, `make-machine` begins by calling the procedure `make-new-machine` to construct the parts of the machine model that are common to all register machines. This basic machine model constructed by `make-new-machine` is essentially a container for some registers and a stack, together with an execution mechanism that processes the controller instructions one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Make-machine` then extends this basic model (by sending it messages) to include the registers, operations, and controller of the particular machine being defined. First it allocates a register in the new machine for each of the supplied register names and installs the designated operations in the machine. Then it uses an *assembler* (described below in [5.2.2](#g_t5_002e2_002e2)) to transform the controller list into instructions for the new machine and installs these as the machine’s instruction sequence. `Make-machine` returns as its value the modified machine model."

    "## 5.2.2 The Assembler\n",
    "\n",
    "The assembler transforms the sequence of controller expressions for a machine into a corresponding list of machine instructions, each with its execution procedure. Overall, the assembler is much like the evaluators we studied in [Chapter 4](Chapter-4.xhtml#Chapter-4)—there is an input language (in this case, the register-machine language) and we must perform an appropriate action for each type of expression in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique of producing an execution procedure for each instruction is just what we used in [4.1.7](4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e7) to speed up the evaluator by separating analysis from runtime execution. As we saw in [Chapter 4](Chapter-4.xhtml#Chapter-4), much useful analysis of Scheme expressions could be performed without knowing the actual values of variables. Here, analogously, much useful analysis of register-machine-language expressions can be performed without knowing the actual contents of machine registers. For example, we can replace references to registers by pointers to the register objects, and we can replace references to labels by pointers to the place in the instruction sequence that the label designates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before it can generate the instruction execution procedures, the assembler must know what all the labels refer to, so it begins by scanning the controller text to separate the labels from the instructions. As it scans the text, it constructs both a list of instructions and a table that associates each label with a pointer into that list. Then the assembler augments the instruction list by inserting the execution procedure for each instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assemble` procedure is the main entry to the assembler. It takes the controller text and the machine model as arguments and returns the instruction sequence to be stored in the model. `Assemble` calls `extract-labels` to build the initial instruction list and label table from the supplied controller text. The second argument to `extract-labels` is a procedure to be called to process these results: This procedure uses `update-insts!` to generate the instruction execution procedures and insert them into the instruction list, and returns the modified list."
