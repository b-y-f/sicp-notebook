    "# 3.1 Assignment and Local State\n",
    "\n",
    "We ordinarily view the world as populated by independent objects, each of which has a state that changes over time. An object is said to “have state” if its behavior is influenced by its history. A bank account, for example, has state in that the answer to the question “Can I withdraw \\$100?” depends upon the history of deposit and withdrawal transactions. We can characterize an object’s state by one or more *state variables*, which among them maintain enough information about history to determine the object’s current behavior. In a simple banking system, we could characterize the state of an account by a current balance rather than by remembering the entire history of account transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a system composed of many objects, the objects are rarely completely independent. Each may influence the states of others through interactions, which serve to couple the state variables of one object to those of other objects. Indeed, the view that a system is composed of separate objects is most useful when the state variables of the system can be grouped into closely coupled subsystems that are only loosely coupled to other subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This view of a system can be a powerful framework for organizing computational models of the system. For such a model to be modular, it should be decomposed into computational objects that model the actual objects in the system. Each computational object must have its own *local state variables* describing the actual object’s state. Since the states of objects in the system being modeled change over time, the state variables of the corresponding computational objects must also change. If we choose to model the flow of time in the system by the elapsed time in the computer, then we must have a way to construct computational objects whose behaviors change as our programs run. In particular, if we wish to model state variables by ordinary symbolic names in the programming language, then the language must provide an *assignment operator* to enable us to change the value associated with a name.\n",

    "## 3.1.1 Local State Variables\n",

    "To illustrate what we mean by having a computational object with time-varying state, let us model the situation of withdrawing money from a bank account. We will do this using a procedure `withdraw`, which takes as argument an `amount` to be withdrawn. If there is enough money in the account to accommodate the withdrawal, then `withdraw` should return the balance remaining after the withdrawal. Otherwise, `withdraw` should return the message *Insufficient funds*. For example, if we begin with \\$100 in the account, we should obtain the following sequence of responses using `withdraw`:"

Within this local environment, we use `lambda` to create a procedure that takes `amount` as an argument and behaves like our previous `withdraw` procedure. This procedure—returned as the result of evaluating the `let` expression—is `new-withdraw`, which behaves in precisely the same way as `withdraw` but whose variable `balance` is not accessible by any other procedure.^[In programming-language jargon, the variable `balance` is said to be *encapsulated* within the `new-withdraw` procedure. Encapsulation reflects the general system-design principle known as the *hiding principle*: One can make a system more modular and robust by protecting parts of the system from each other; that is, by providing information access only to those parts of the system that have a “need to know.”]\n",

    "Combining `set!` with local variables is the general programming technique we will use for constructing computational objects with local state. Unfortunately, using this technique raises a serious problem: When we first introduced procedures, we also introduced the substitution model of evaluation ([1.1.5](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e5)) to provide an interpretation of what procedure application means. We said that applying a procedure should be interpreted as evaluating the body of the procedure with the formal parameters replaced by their values. The trouble is that, as soon as we introduce assignment into our language, substitution is no longer an adequate model of procedure application. (We will see why this is so in [3.1.3](#g_t3_002e1_002e3).) As a consequence, we technically have at this point no way to understand why the `new-withdraw` procedure behaves as claimed above. In order to really understand a procedure such as `new-withdraw`, we will need to develop a new model of procedure application. In [3.2](3_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e2) we will introduce such a model, together with an explanation of `set!` and local variables. First, however, we examine some variations on the theme established by `new-withdraw`.\n",

This will be clearer after the discussion of the environment model of evaluation in [3.2](3_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e2). (See also [Exercise 3.10](3_002e2.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e10).)]"

Chapter 3 of [Knuth 1981](References.xhtml#Knuth-1981) includes an extensive discussion of techniques for generating sequences of random numbers and establishing their statistical properties. Notice that the `rand-update` procedure computes a mathematical function: Given the same input twice, it produces the same output. Therefore, the number sequence produced by `rand-update` certainly is not “random,” if by “random” we insist that each number in the sequence is unrelated to the preceding number. The relation between “real randomness” and so-called *pseudo-random* sequences, which are produced by well-determined computations and yet have suitable statistical properties, is a complex question involving difficult issues in mathematics and philosophy. Kolmogorov, Solomonoff, and Chaitin have made great progress in clarifying these issues; a discussion can be found in [Chaitin 1975](References.xhtml#Chaitin-1975).]\n",

    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo method consists of choosing sample experiments at random from a large set and then making deductions on the basis of the probabilities estimated from tabulating the results of those experiments. For example, we can approximate $\\pi$ using the fact that $6/\\pi^{2}$ is the probability that two integers chosen at random will have no factors in common; that is, that their greatest common divisor will be 1.^[This theorem is due to E. Cesàro. See section 4.5.2 of [Knuth 1981](References.xhtml#Knuth-1981) for a discussion and a proof.] To obtain the approximation to $\\pi$, we perform a large number of experiments. In each experiment we choose two integers at random and perform a test to see if their GCD is 1. The fraction of times that the test is passed gives us our estimate of $6/\\pi^{2}$, and from this we obtain our approximation to $\\pi$.\n",

    "While the program is still simple, it betrays some painful breaches of modularity. In our first version of the program, using `rand`, we can express the Monte Carlo method directly as a general `monte-carlo` procedure that takes as an argument an arbitrary `experiment` procedure. In our second version of the program, with no local state for the random-number generator, `random-gcd-test` must explicitly manipulate the random numbers `x1` and `x2` and recycle `x2` through the iterative loop as the new input to `rand-update`. This explicit handling of the random numbers intertwines the structure of accumulating test results with the fact that our particular experiment uses two random numbers, whereas other Monte Carlo experiments might use one random number or three. Even the top-level procedure `estimate-pi` has to be concerned with supplying an initial random number. The fact that the random-number generator’s insides are leaking out into other parts of the program makes it difficult for us to isolate the Monte Carlo idea so that it can be applied to other tasks. In the first version of the program, assignment encapsulates the state of the random-number generator within the `rand` procedure, so that the details of random-number generation remain independent of the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general phenomenon illustrated by the Monte Carlo example is this: From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other parts appear to change with time. They have hidden time-varying local state. If we wish to write computer programs whose structure reflects this decomposition, we make computational objects (such as bank accounts and random-number generators) whose behavior changes with time. We model state with local state variables, and we model the changes of state with assignments to those variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tempting to conclude this discussion by saying that, by introducing assignment and the technique of hiding state in local variables, we are able to structure systems in a more modular fashion than if all state had to be manipulated explicitly, by passing additional parameters. Unfortunately, as we shall see, the story is not so simple.\n",

    "**Exercise 3.5:** *Monte Carlo integration* is a method of estimating definite integrals by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Consider computing the area of a region of space described by a predicate $P(x,y)$ that is true for points $(x,y)$ in the region and false for points not in the region. For example, the region contained within a circle of radius 3 centered at (5, 7) is described by the predicate that tests whether ${(x - 5)^{2}} + {(y - 7)^{2} \\leq 3^{2}}$. To estimate the area of the region described by such a predicate, begin by choosing a rectangle that contains the region. For example, a rectangle with diagonally opposite corners at (2, 4) and (8, 10) contains the circle above. The desired integral is the area of that portion of the rectangle that lies in the region. We can estimate the integral by picking, at random, points $(x,y)$ that lie in the rectangle, and testing $P(x,y)$ for each point to determine whether the point lies in the region. If we try this with many points, then the fraction of points that fall in the region should give an estimate of the proportion of the rectangle that lies in the region. Hence, multiplying this fraction by the area of the entire rectangle should produce an estimate of the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement Monte Carlo integration as a procedure `estimate-integral` that takes as arguments a predicate `P`, upper and lower bounds `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` for the rectangle, and the number of trials to perform in order to produce the estimate. Your procedure should use the same `monte-carlo` procedure that was used above to estimate $\\pi$. Use your `estimate-integral` to produce an estimate of $\\pi$ by measuring the area of a unit circle.\n",

    "With reference to the above remarks on “sameness” and “change,” observe that if Peter and Paul could only examine their bank balances, and could not perform operations that changed the balance, then the issue of whether the two accounts are distinct would be moot. In general, so long as we never modify data objects, we can regard a compound data object to be precisely the totality of its pieces. For example, a rational number is determined by giving its numerator and its denominator. But this view is no longer valid in the presence of change, where a compound data object has an “identity” that is something different from the pieces of which it is composed. A bank account is still “the same” bank account even if we change the balance by making a withdrawal; conversely, we could have two different bank accounts with the same state information. This complication is a consequence, not of our programming language, but of our perception of a bank account as an object. We do not, for example, ordinarily regard a rational number as a changeable object with identity, such that we could change the numerator and still have “the same” rational number.\n",

    "In contrast to functional programming, programming that makes extensive use of assignment is known as *imperative programming*. In addition to raising complications about computational models, programs written in imperative style are susceptible to bugs that cannot occur in functional programs. For example, recall the iterative factorial program from [1.2.1](1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2_002e1):"

    "would have produced a different, incorrect result. In general, programming with assignment forces us to carefully consider the relative orders of the assignments to make sure that each statement is using the correct version of the variables that have been changed. This issue simply does not arise in functional programs.^[In view of this, it is ironic that introductory programming is most often taught in a highly imperative style. This may be a vestige of a belief, common throughout the 1960s and 1970s, that programs that call procedures must inherently be less efficient than programs that perform assignments. ([Steele 1977](References.xhtml#Steele-1977) debunks this argument.) Alternatively it may reflect a view that step-by-step assignment is easier for beginners to visualize than procedure call. Whatever the reason, it often saddles beginning programmers with “should I set this variable before or after that one” concerns that can complicate programming and obscure the important ideas.]\n",

Suppose that our banking system requires the ability to make joint accounts. Define a procedure `make-joint` that accomplishes this. `Make-joint` should take three arguments. The first is a password-protected account. The second argument must match the password with which the account was defined in order for the `make-joint` operation to proceed. The third argument is a new password. `Make-joint` is to create an additional access to the original account using the new password.
