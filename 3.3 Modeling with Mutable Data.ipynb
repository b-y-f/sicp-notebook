    "# 3.3 Modeling with Mutable Data\n",
    "\n",
    "[Chapter 2](Chapter-2.xhtml#Chapter-2) dealt with compound data as a means for constructing computational objects that have several parts, in order to model real-world objects that have several aspects. In that chapter we introduced the discipline of data abstraction, according to which data structures are specified in terms of constructors, which create data objects, and selectors, which access the parts of compound data objects. But we now know that there is another aspect of data that chapter 2 did not address. The desire to model systems composed of objects that have changing state leads us to the need to modify compound data objects, as well as to construct and select from them. In order to model compound objects with changing state, we will design data abstractions to include, in addition to selectors and constructors, operations called *mutators*, which modify data objects. For instance, modeling a banking system requires us to change account balances. Thus, a data structure for representing bank accounts might admit an operation"

    "Chapter 2 introduced pairs as a general-purpose “glue” for synthesizing compound data. We begin this section by defining basic mutators for pairs, so that pairs can serve as building blocks for constructing mutable data objects. These mutators greatly enhance the representational power of pairs, enabling us to build data structures other than the sequences and trees that we worked with in [2.2](2_002e2.xhtml#g_t2_002e2). We also present some examples of simulations in which complex systems are modeled as collections of objects with local state.\n",

    "The basic operations on pairs—`cons`, `car`, and `cdr`—can be used to construct list structure and to select parts from list structure, but they are incapable of modifying list structure. The same is true of the list operations we have used so far, such as `append` and `list`, since these can be defined in terms of `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`. To modify list structures we need new operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primitive mutators for pairs are `set-car!` and `set-cdr!`. `Set-car!` takes two arguments, the first of which must be a pair. It modifies this pair, replacing the `car` pointer by a pointer to the second argument of `set-car!`.^[`Set-car!` and `set-cdr!` return implementation-dependent values. Like `set!`, they should be used only for their effect.]\n",

    "As an example, suppose that `x` is bound to the list `((a b) c d)` and `y` to the list `(e f)` as illustrated in [Figure 3.12](#Figure-3_002e12). Evaluating the expression ` (set-car!  x y)` modifies the pair to which `x` is bound, replacing its `car` by the value of `y`. The result of the operation is shown in [Figure 3.13](#Figure-3_002e13). The structure `x` has been modified and would now be printed as `((e f) c d)`. The pairs representing the list `(a b)`, identified by the pointer that was replaced, are now detached from the original structure.^[We see from this that mutation operations on lists can create “garbage” that is not part of any accessible structure. We will see in [5.3.2](5_002e3.xhtml#g_t5_002e3_002e2) that Lisp memory-management systems include a *garbage collector*, which identifies and recycles the memory space used by unneeded pairs.]\n",

We obtain the new pair, set its `car` and `cdr` pointers to the designated objects, and return the new pair as the result of the `cons`.^[`Get-new-pair` is one of the operations that must be implemented as part of the memory management required by a Lisp implementation.

We mentioned there that admitting change to our language requires that a compound object must have an “identity” that is something different from the pieces from which it is composed. In Lisp, we consider this “identity” to be the quality that is tested by `eq?`, i.e., by equality of pointers. Since in most Lisp implementations a pointer is essentially a memory address, we are “solving the problem” of defining the identity of objects by stipulating that a data object “itself” is the information stored in some particular set of memory locations in the computer.

    "Because a queue is a sequence of items, we could certainly represent it as an ordinary list; the front of the queue would be the `car` of the list, inserting an item in the queue would amount to appending a new element at the end of the list, and deleting an item from the queue would just be taking the `cdr` of the list. However, this representation is inefficient, because in order to insert an item we must scan the list until we reach the end. Since the only method we have for scanning a list is by successive `cdr` operations, this scanning requires $\\Theta(n)$ steps for a list of $n$ items. A simple modification to the list representation overcomes this disadvantage by allowing the queue operations to be implemented so that they require $\\Theta(1)$ steps; that is, so that the number of steps needed is independent of the length of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty with the list representation arises from the need to scan to find the end of the list. The reason we need to scan is that, although the standard way of representing a list as a chain of pairs readily provides us with a pointer to the beginning of the list, it gives us no easily accessible pointer to the end. The modification that avoids the drawback is to represent the queue as a list, together with an additional pointer that indicates the final pair in the list. That way, when we go to insert an item, we can consult the rear pointer and so avoid scanning the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue is represented, then, as a pair of pointers, `front-ptr` and `rear-ptr`, which indicate, respectively, the first and last pairs in an ordinary list.

In the implementation of data-directed programming in [2.4.3](2_002e4.xhtml#g_t2_002e4_002e3), we made extensive use of two-dimensional tables, in which information is stored and retrieved using two keys.

The records are glued together to form a list by pairs whose `car`s point to successive records. These gluing pairs are called the *backbone* of the table. In order to have a place that we can change when we add a new record to the table, we build the table as a *headed list*. A headed list has a special backbone pair at the beginning, which holds a dummy “record”—in this case the arbitrarily chosen symbol `*table*`.

    "\n",
    "Designing complex digital systems, such as computers, is an important engineering activity. Digital systems are constructed by interconnecting simple elements. Although the behavior of these individual elements is simple, networks of them can have very complex behavior. Computer simulation of proposed circuit designs is an important tool used by digital systems engineers. In this section we design a system for performing digital logic simulations. This system typifies a kind of program called an *event-driven simulation*, in which actions (“events”) trigger further events that happen at a later time, which in turn trigger more events, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our computational model of a circuit will be composed of objects that correspond to the elementary components from which the circuit is constructed. There are *wires*, which carry *digital signals*. A digital signal may at any moment have only one of two possible values, 0 and 1. There are also various types of digital *function boxes*, which connect wires carrying input signals to other output wires. Such boxes produce output signals computed from their input signals. The output signal is delayed by a time that depends on the type of the function box. For example, an *inverter* is a primitive function box that inverts its input. If the input signal to an inverter changes to 0, then one inverter-delay later the inverter will change its output signal to 1. If the input signal to an inverter changes to 1, then one inverter-delay later the inverter will change its output signal to 0. We draw an inverter symbolically as in [Figure 3.24](#Figure-3_002e24). An *and-gate*, also shown in figure 3.24, is a primitive function box with two inputs and one output. It drives its output signal to a value that is the *logical and* of the inputs. That is, if both of its input signals become 1, then one and-gate-delay time later the and-gate will force its output signal to be 1; otherwise the output will be 0. An *or-gate* is a similar two-input primitive function box that drives its output signal to a value that is the *logical or* of the inputs. That is, the output will become 1 if at least one of the input signals is 1; otherwise the output will become 0.\n",

For example, the *half-adder* circuit shown in [Figure 3.25](#Figure-3_002e25) consists of an or-gate, two and-gates, and an inverter. It takes two input signals, A and B, and has two output signals, S and C. S will become 1 whenever precisely one of A and B is 1, and C will become 1 whenever A and B are both 1. We can see from the figure that, because of the delays involved, the outputs may be generated at different times. Many of the difficulties in the design of digital circuits arise from this fact.\n",

The procedure should take as arguments three lists of $n$ wires each—the $A_{k}$, the $B_{k}$, and the $S_{k}$—and also another wire $C$.

    "\n",
    "Computer programs are traditionally organized as one-directional computations, which perform operations on prespecified arguments to produce desired outputs. On the other hand, we often model systems in terms of relations among quantities. For example, a mathematical model of a mechanical structure might include the information that the deflection $d$ of a metal rod is related to the force $F$ on the rod, the length $L$ of the rod, the cross-sectional area $A$, and the elastic modulus $E$ via the equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$${dAE}\\, = \\,{FL.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Such an equation is not one-directional. Given any four of the quantities, we can use it to compute the fifth. Yet translating the equation into a traditional computer language would force us to choose one of the quantities to be computed in terms of the other four. Thus, a procedure for computing the area $A$ could not be used to compute the deflection $d$, even though the computations of $A$ and $d$ arise from the same equation.^[Constraint propagation first appeared in the incredibly forward-looking SKETCHPAD system of Ivan [Sutherland (1963)](References.xhtml#Sutherland-_00281963_0029). A beautiful constraint-propagation system based on the Smalltalk language was developed by Alan [Borning (1977)](References.xhtml#Borning-_00281977_0029) at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. Sussman, Stallman, and Steele applied constraint propagation to electrical circuit analysis ([Sussman and Stallman 1975](References.xhtml#Sussman-and-Stallman-1975); [Sussman and Steele 1980](References.xhtml#Sussman-and-Steele-1980)). TK!Solver ([Konopasek and Jayaraman 1984](References.xhtml#Konopasek-and-Jayaraman-1984)) is an extensive modeling environment based on constraints.]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we sketch the design of a language that enables us to work in terms of relations themselves. The primitive elements of the language are *primitive constraints*, which state that certain relations hold between quantities. For example, `(adder a b c)` specifies that the quantities $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be related by the equation $a + b = c$, `(multiplier x y z)` expresses the constraint $xy = z$, and `(constant 3.14 x)` says that the value of $x$ must be 3.14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our language provides a means of combining primitive constraints in order to express more complex relations. We combine constraints by constructing *constraint networks*, in which constraints are joined by *connectors*. A connector is an object that “holds” a value that may participate in one or more constraints. For example, we know that the relationship between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures is \n",
    "\n",
    "$${9C}\\, = \\,{5(F - 32).}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Such a constraint can be thought of as a network consisting of primitive adder, multiplier, and constant constraints ([Figure 3.28](#Figure-3_002e28)). In the figure, we see on the left a multiplier box with three terminals, labeled $m1$, $m2$, and $p$. These connect the multiplier to the rest of the network as follows: The $m1$ terminal is linked to a connector $C$, which will hold the Celsius temperature. The $m2$ terminal is linked to a connector $w$, which is also linked to a constant box that holds 9. The $p$ terminal, which the multiplier box constrains to be the product of $m1$ and $m2$, is linked to the $p$ terminal of another multiplier box, whose $m2$ is connected to a constant 5 and whose $m1$ is connected to one of the terms in a sum.\n",

    "**Figure 3.28:** The relation $9C = 5(F - 32)$ expressed as a constraint network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation by such a network proceeds as follows: When a connector is given a value (by the user or by a constraint box to which it is linked), it awakens all of its associated constraints (except for the constraint that just awakened it) to inform them that it has a value. Each awakened constraint box then polls its connectors to see if there is enough information to determine a value for a connector. If so, the box sets that connector, which then awakens all of its associated constraints, and so on. For instance, in conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, $w$, $x$, and $y$ are immediately set by the constant boxes to 9, 5, and 32, respectively. The connectors awaken the multipliers and the adder, which determine that there is not enough information to proceed. If the user (or some other part of the network) sets $C$ to a value (say 25), the leftmost multiplier will be awakened, and it will set $u$ to $25 \\cdot 9 = 225$. Then $u$ awakens the second multiplier, which sets $v$ to 45, and $v$ awakens the adder, which sets $f$ to 77.\n",
