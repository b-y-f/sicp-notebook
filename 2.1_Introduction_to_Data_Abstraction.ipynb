    "# 2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1.1.8](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e8), we noted that a procedure used as an element in creating a more complex procedure could be regarded not only as a collection of particular operations but also as a procedural abstraction. That is, the details of how the procedure was implemented could be suppressed, and the particular procedure itself could be replaced by any other procedure with the same overall behavior. In other words, we could make an abstraction that would separate the way the procedure would be used from the details of how the procedure would be implemented in terms of more primitive procedures. The analogous notion for compound data is called *data abstraction*. Data abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a compound data object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that are to use compound data objects so that they operate on “abstract data.” That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make no assumptions about the data that are not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand. At the same time, a “concrete” data representation is defined independent of the programs that use the data. The interface between these two parts of our system will be a set of procedures, called *selectors* and *constructors*, that implement the abstract data in terms of the concrete representation. To illustrate this technique, we will consider how to design a set of procedures for manipulating rational numbers.\n",

    "## 2.1.1 Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to do arithmetic with rational numbers. We want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them and to test whether two rational numbers are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by assuming that we already have a way of constructing a rational number from a numerator and a denominator. We also assume that, given a rational number, we have a way of extracting (or selecting) its numerator and its denominator. Let us further assume that the constructor and selectors are available as procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(make-rat ⟨n⟩ ⟨d⟩)` returns the rational number whose numerator is the integer `⟨n⟩` and whose denominator is the integer `⟨d⟩`.\n",
    "- `(numer ⟨x⟩)` returns the numerator of the rational number `⟨x⟩`.\n",
    "- `(denom ⟨x⟩)` returns the denominator of the rational number `⟨x⟩`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using here a powerful strategy of synthesis: *wishful thinking*. We haven’t yet said how a rational number is represented, or how the procedures `numer`, `denom`, and `make-rat` should be implemented. Even so, if we did have these three procedures, we could then add, subtract, multiply, divide, and test equality by using the following relations: \n",

    "## 2.1.2 Abstraction Barriers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing with more examples of compound data and data abstraction, let us consider some of the issues raised by the rational-number example. We defined the rational-number operations in terms of a constructor `make-rat` and selectors `numer` and `denom`. In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in manipulating the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can envision the structure of the rational-number system as shown in [Figure 2.1](#Figure-2_002e1). The horizontal lines represent *abstraction barriers* that isolate different “levels” of the system. At each level, the barrier separates the programs (above) that use the data abstraction from the programs (below) that implement the data abstraction. Programs that use rational numbers manipulate them solely in terms of the procedures supplied “for public use” by the rational-number package: `add-rat`, `sub-rat`, `mul-rat`, `div-rat`, and `equal-rat?`. These, in turn, are implemented solely in terms of the constructor and selectors `make-rat`, `numer`, and `denom`, which themselves are implemented in terms of pairs. The details of how pairs are implemented are irrelevant to the rest of the rational-number package so long as pairs can be manipulated by the use of `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`. In effect, procedures at each level are the interfaces that define the abstraction barriers and connect the different levels.\n",

    "**Figure 2.1:** Data-abstraction barriers in the rational-number package.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple idea has many advantages. One advantage is that it makes programs much easier to maintain and to modify. Any complex data structure can be represented in a variety of ways with the primitive data structures provided by a programming language. Of course, the choice of representation influences the programs that operate on it; thus, if the representation were to be changed at some later time, all such programs might have to be modified accordingly. This task could be time-consuming and expensive in the case of large programs unless the dependence on the representation were to be confined by design to a very few program modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an alternate way to address the problem of reducing rational numbers to lowest terms is to perform the reduction whenever we access the parts of a rational number, rather than when we construct it. This leads to different constructor and selector procedures:"

    " In fact, this is the only condition `make-rat`, `numer`, and `denom` must fulfill in order to form a suitable basis for a rational-number representation. In general, we can think of data as defined by some collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation.^[Surprisingly, this idea is very difficult to formulate rigorously. There are two approaches to giving such a formulation. One, pioneered by C. A. R. [Hoare (1972)](References.xhtml#Hoare-_00281972_0029), is known as the method of *abstract models*. It formalizes the “procedures plus conditions” specification as outlined in the rational-number example above. Note that the condition on the rational-number representation was stated in terms of facts about integers (equality and division). In general, abstract models define new kinds of data objects in terms of previously defined types of data objects. Assertions about data objects can therefore be checked by reducing them to assertions about previously defined data objects. Another approach, introduced by Zilles at MIT, by Goguen, Thatcher, Wagner, and Wright at IBM (see [Thatcher et al. 1978](References.xhtml#Thatcher-et-al_002e-1978)), and by Guttag at Toronto (see [Guttag 1977](References.xhtml#Guttag-1977)), is called *algebraic specification*. It regards the “procedures” as elements of an abstract algebraic system whose behavior is specified by axioms that correspond to our “conditions,” and uses the techniques of abstract algebra to check assertions about data objects. Both methods are surveyed in the paper by [Liskov and Zilles (1975)](References.xhtml#Liskov-and-Zilles-_00281975_0029).]\n",

    "This point of view can serve to define not only “high-level” data objects, such as rational numbers, but lower-level objects as well. Consider the notion of a pair, which we used in order to define our rational numbers. We never actually said what a pair was, only that the language supplied procedures `cons`, `car`, and `cdr` for operating on pairs. But the only thing we need to know about these three operations is that if we glue two objects together using `cons` we can retrieve the objects using `car` and `cdr`. That is, the operations satisfy the condition that, for any objects `x` and `y`, if `z` is `(cons x y)` then `(car z)` is `x` and `(cdr z)` is `y`. Indeed, we mentioned that these three procedures are included as primitives in our language. However, any triple of procedures that satisfies the above condition can be used as the basis for implementing pairs. This point is illustrated strikingly by the fact that we could implement `cons`, `car`, and `cdr` without using any data structures at all but only using procedures. Here are the definitions:"

    "This use of procedures corresponds to nothing like our intuitive notion of what data should be. Nevertheless, all we need to do to show that this is a valid way to represent pairs is to verify that these procedures satisfy the condition given above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subtle point to notice is that the value returned by `(cons x y)` is a procedure—namely the internally defined procedure `dispatch`, which takes one argument and returns either `x` or `y` depending on whether the argument is 0 or 1. Correspondingly, `(car z)` is defined to apply `z` to 0. Hence, if `z` is the procedure formed by `(cons x y)`, then `z` applied to 0 will yield `x`. Thus, we have shown that `(car (cons x y))` yields `x`, as desired. Similarly, `(cdr (cons x y))` applies the procedure returned by `(cons x y)` to 1, which returns `y`. Therefore, this procedural implementation of pairs is a valid implementation, and if we access pairs using only `cons`, `car`, and `cdr` we cannot distinguish this implementation from one that uses “real” data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of exhibiting the procedural representation of pairs is not that our language works this way (Scheme, and Lisp systems in general, implement pairs directly, for efficiency reasons) but that it could work this way. The procedural representation, although obscure, is a perfectly adequate way to represent pairs, since it fulfills the only conditions that pairs need to fulfill. This example also demonstrates that the ability to manipulate procedures as objects automatically provides the ability to represent compound data. This may seem a curiosity now, but procedural representations of data will play a central role in our programming repertoire. This style of programming is often called *message passing*, and we will be using it as a basic tool in [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) when we address the issues of modeling and simulation.\n",

Thus, if you have a 6.8-ohm 10% resistor in parallel with a 4.7-ohm 5% resistor, the resistance of the combination can range from about 2.58 ohms (if the two resistors are at the lower bounds) to about 2.97 ohms (if the two resistors are at the upper bounds).\n",
